# Active Context: Historical Trend Analysis

## Current Focus
**Implementing Historical Trend Analysis**

We are now focusing on enhancing the core analytical capabilities by implementing historical trend analysis. This feature will allow users to track how their codebase evolves over time, providing insights into the long-term health and trajectory of their project.

## Recent Changes
- **Implemented Language-Aware Security Analysis**: Added a new `SecurityAnalyzer` that detects the project's language. For Python projects, it runs `bandit` to find security vulnerabilities and adds a "Security Analysis" section to the report. The system is now architected to easily support other languages and tools in the future.
- **Fixed Report Generation Regression**: Resolved an issue where running the CLI with a specific analysis flag (e.g., `--trend-analysis`) would exclude all other analysis sections from the report.
- **Improved CLI Usability**: The `analyze` command now runs all analyses by default. Flags have been changed to be opt-out (e.g., `--no-code-health`) rather than opt-in, making the tool more intuitive and ensuring a complete report is generated with a single command.
- Completed Historical Trend Analysis (contributors, commit frequency, file size, baselines, flexible periods)
- CLI and test suite now fully compatible and robust
- Enhanced error handling for non-Git repositories
