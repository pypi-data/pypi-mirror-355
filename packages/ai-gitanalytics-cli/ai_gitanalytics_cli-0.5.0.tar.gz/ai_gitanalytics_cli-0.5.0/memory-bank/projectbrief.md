# Project Brief: Git Analytics CLI

This project aims to build a Python-based command-line interface (CLI) tool named "Git Analytics".

The core purpose of this tool is to analyze Git repositories, extract commit history within specified date ranges, and leverage AI models to generate insightful summaries of the development activity.

The final output will be presented in user-friendly formats, specifically Markdown and JSON reports.

**Core Requirements:**
- Git commit extraction with date filtering.
- AI-powered commit summarization using multiple models via OpenRouter.
- Markdown & JSON report generation.
- Intuitive CLI interface.
- Pip-installable package.
