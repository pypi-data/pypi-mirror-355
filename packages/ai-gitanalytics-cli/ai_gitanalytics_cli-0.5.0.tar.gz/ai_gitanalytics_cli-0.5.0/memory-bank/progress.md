# Progress: Git Analytics CLI

## Current Status: Version 0.4.0 (Implementing Historical Trend Analysis)

### Description
The tool now has a solid foundation with all core features implemented and tested. We are enhancing its analytical capabilities by adding historical trend analysis, which will provide insights into how the codebase evolves over time.

## What Works

- **AI-Powered Thematic Analysis**: Automatically categorizes commits using AI, even in repositories without Conventional Commits.
- **Code-Aware Summaries**: AI generates summaries by analyzing both commit messages and code diffs.
- **High-Level Executive Summary**: Provides a concise overview of the entire analysis period.
- **Smart Caching**: Improves performance by caching AI results.
- **Branch Selection**: Allows analysis of any branch, not just the currently checked-out one.
- **Contributor Analysis**: Generates reports summarizing contributions by author.
- **Code Churn & Complexity Analysis**: Identifies high-churn files and measures their cyclomatic complexity to flag potential technical debt.
- **Comprehensive Automated Testing**: A full `pytest` suite ensures the stability and correctness of all features.
- **Flexible Reporting**: Generates reports in Markdown and JSON formats.
- **Secure Configuration**: Manages API keys and settings securely.
- **Historical Trend Analysis**: tracks contributors, commit frequency, file size changes; supports baselines and flexible time periods; robust error handling
- **All tests passing (except known xfail for sys.exit(0))**
- **CLI/test compatibility improvements**
- **Robust CLI Experience**: Fixed a regression where only one analysis type would run at a time. All analyses (Thematic, Code Health, Contributor, Trend) now run by default, providing a complete report with a single command. The CLI flags have been updated to be more intuitive (e.g., `--no-code-health` to disable a specific analysis).
- **Language-Aware Security Analysis**: The tool now automatically detects the project's language and runs a security scan using the appropriate tool. The initial implementation supports Python using `bandit` and is designed to be easily extendable to other languages.

## What's Left to Build

This section tracks ideas and future enhancements.

### Future Enhancements
- **CI/CD Integration**: Provide a mechanism to run `gitanalytics` in a CI/CD pipeline and fail builds or comment on PRs based on the results.
- **Interactive HTML Reports**: Move beyond Markdown to generate rich, interactive reports with charts and graphs using a library like Plotly or D3.js.
- **Refined AI Prompting**: Further tune the AI prompts for even more accurate and insightful summaries and classifications.
