# Product Context: Git Analytics CLI

## The Problem

Development teams often struggle to get a high-level overview of the work being done in a repository. Reviewing raw commit logs is time-consuming and often lacks context. It's difficult to quickly understand the narrative of a project's evolution, track the impact of features, or generate reports for stakeholders without significant manual effort.

## The Solution

The Git Analytics CLI tool solves this problem by automating the analysis of a Git repository. It acts as an intelligent assistant that reads through commit history and generates concise, human-readable summaries.

## How it Should Work

A developer should be able to run a single command pointed at a local repository. The tool will then:
1.  Extract the relevant commit data.
2.  Send this data to a powerful AI model for analysis.
3.  Generate a clean, insightful report in Markdown or JSON.
4.  Provide features for cost monitoring, performance tracking, and caching to ensure an efficient and affordable user experience.

## User Experience Goals

- **Simplicity:** The CLI should be intuitive and easy to use.
- **Speed:** Analysis should be fast, aiming for <30 seconds for 100 commits.
- **Insightful:** The AI-generated summaries should provide real value and understanding.
- **Cost-Effective:** A generous free tier should make the tool accessible, with clear and predictable pricing for advanced usage.
