[![Documentation](https://readthedocs.org/projects/transients-pipeline/badge/?version=latest)](https://transients-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest)

The Transients Pipeline (or "TraP") is a Python based system for detecting and responding to transient
and variable sources in a stream of astronomical images.
It primarily targets LOFAR data, but is also applicable to a range of other instruments.

An overview of the package and it's initial design can be found in the original [TraP paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26C....11...25S/abstract).
If you make use of TraP in work leading to a publication, we ask that you cite this reference.
