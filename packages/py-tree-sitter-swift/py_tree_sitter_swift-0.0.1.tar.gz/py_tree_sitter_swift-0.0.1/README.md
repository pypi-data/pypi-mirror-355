# py-tree-sitter-swift

This contains a [`tree-sitter`](https://tree-sitter.github.io/tree-sitter) grammar for the Swift programming language.
This is a fork of https://github.com/alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift meant to try building python wheels
as the original project does not have pypi releases yet. See https://github.com/alex-pinkus/tree-sitter-swift/issues/445
for more info.
