	abstract = {The net storage heat flux is not only a large part of the urban surface energy balance (SEB) but its determination remains a significant challenge. The diurnal hysteresis behaviour found between the net storage heat flux (ΔQS) and net all-wave radiation (Q*) has been captured in the Objective Hysteresis Model (OHM) parametrization of ΔQS. Although, successfully used in urban areas, the limited availability of coefficients for OHM hampers application. To facilitate use, and enhance physical interpretations of the OHM coefficients, an analytical solution of the 1-dimensional advection-diffusion equation of coupled heat and liquid water transport in conjunction with the SEB is conducted, allowing development of AnOHM (Analytical Objective Hysteresis Model). A sensitivity test of AnOHM to surface properties and hydrometeorological forcing is undertaken using a stochastic approach (the Subset Simulation). From this albedo, Bowen ratio and bulk transfer coefficient, solar radiation and wind speed are identified as being critical. AnOHM, driven by local meteorological conditions at five different land use areas, is shown to simulate the ΔQS flux well (RMSE values of {\textasciitilde}30 W m−2). The intra-annual dynamics of OHM coefficients to are explored which offers significant potential to enhance modelling of the surface energy balance over a wider range of conditions.},

	abstract = {Energy balance studies require knowledge of the heat flux at the soil surface. This flux is determined by summing the heat flux at a reference depth (zr) some centimeters below the surface and the rate of change of heat storage in the soil above zr. The rate of change of heat storage, or heat storage for short (deltaS), is calculated from soil volumetric heat capacity (C) and temperature. The objectives of this study were to determine how choices regarding zr, C measurements, and deltaS calculations all affect the accuracy of deltaS data. Heat transfer theory and data from three field sites were used toward these ends. In some studies, shallow reference depths have been used and deltaS neglected. Our results indicate that when zr is sufficiently deep to permit accurate heat flux measurements, deltaS is too large to neglect. Three methods for determining C were evaluated: soil sampling, the ThetaProbe soil moisture sensor, and heat pulse sensors. When C was determined using all three methods simultaneously, the estimates agreed to within 6\% on average; however, the temporal variability of C was best recorded with the automated heat pulse sensors. Three approaches for calculating deltaS were also tested. The common approach of letting C vary in time but neglecting its time derivative caused errors when soil water content was changing. These errors exceeded 200 W m-2 in some cases. The simple approach of assuming a constant C performed similarly. We introduce a third approach that accounts for the time derivative of C and yields the most accurate deltaS data.},

	abstract = {A 27-year soil temperature record at five depths and soil heat flux record at one depth were analyzed for a grassland area in The Netherlands. The annual mean soil temperature of the last 23 years of soil measurements (no data gaps) showed a statistically significant increase of about 1.0°C, consistent with the observed air temperature increase of about 1.3°C for the same period. This positive trend correlates well with global brightening of 5.3Wm−2 per decade. The 10-day mean soil temperature varied smoothly throughout the year with relatively small inter-annual variability. The deeper the measurement depth, the smoother the annual cycle and the smaller the variability. In February and at the end of the year the variability appears to be somewhat larger. A Fast Fourier Transform was applied to the measurements and revealed an annual and daily damping depth of 1.80m and 0.10m, respectively. An example of the usefulness of this data is provided for agriculture, where an aggressive root-knot nematode is affected by the mean soil temperature increase. It appears that the 600 degree day life-cycle threshold is reached 16 days earlier, which may lead to a potential serious increase in agriculture crop damage.},

The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the Philip correction for a variety of SHFPs. The λp were determined without thermal contact resistance and differed from the manufacturer-specified λp. A simplified H formulation was similar to or less than the full H equation for different SHFP shapes. The G ratio (Gp/Gs) was sensitive to λs/λp and H when they were relatively small. Compared with the Gs determined by a gradient method (Gs\_grad), the Gp measured under a full corn (Zea mays, L.) canopy in the field underestimated Gs by 38\% to 62\%. After applying the Philip correction, almost all Gp agreed better with Gs\_grad. Generally, the Gp corrected with measured plate parameters agreed better with Gs\_grad than those corrected with manufacturer-specified values. The Gp corrected with the simplified and full H expression differed for different SHFPs. These results indicate that SHFPs always underestimate Gs and the performance of the Philip correction is affected by λp, plate dimensions and H. An alternative method to measure Gs by a three-needle heat-pulse sensor or a gradient method in which soil temperature and water content are measured at several depths, is recommended.},

Algorithms that calculate LE and H require available energy, the difference between net radiation, RNET, and G. There are a wide range of approaches to model G for large-scale applications, with a subsequent wide range of estimates and accuracies. We provide the largest review of these methods to date (N = 6), evaluating modeled G against measured G from 88 FLUXNET sites. The instantaneous midday variability in G is best captured by models forced with net radiation, while models forced by temperature show the least error at both instantaneous and daily time scales. We produce global decadal data sets of G to illustrate regional and seasonal sensitivities, as well as uncertainty. Global model mean midmorning instantaneous G is highest during September, October, and November at 63.42 (±16.84) Wm−2, while over December, January, and February G is lowest at 53.86 (±18.09) Wm−2 but shows greater intermodel uncertainty.

	abstract = {Heat flux plates are commonly used to measure soil heat flux, a component of the surface energy balance. The plate method is simple and precise, but several previous studies have demonstrated the potential for relatively large errors. Here we present the results of in situ tests of the plate method, and we describe some promising alternative methods. Summertime soil heat flux was measured with heat flux plates and with two alternative methods at each of three sites. In total, three alternative methods were used: a single probe gradient method, a three needle gradient method, and a self-calibrating plate method. The standard plate method underestimated the magnitude of the heat flux by 18 to 66\% depending on the site and type of plate. Agreement between the alternative methods was good with discrepancies ranging from 2 to 6\%. The plates underestimate flux apparently due to a combination of low plate thermal conductivity, thermal contact resistance, and latent heat transfer effects. The three needle gradient method for measuring heat flux performed well at all three sites, providing a good alternative to the standard plate method. The self-calibrating plate method performed well at the one site where it was tested and may also be a good alternative. Increased adoption of these methods should lead to more accurate soil heat flux and surface energy balance data.},

	abstract = {Soil heat flux is an important component of the energy balance at the land surface. Heat flux plates have been used widely to measure soil heat flux, but suffer from errors such as heat flow distortion and soil–plate contact resistance. The Philip correction and self-calibrating heat flux plates have been applied to minimize measurement errors. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effectiveness of heat flux plate correction methods and to introduce improved approaches for applying these methods under field conditions. Soil heat flux at a depth (z) below the surface (Gz) was measured with conventional and self-calibrating plates buried at 2, 6, and 10cm in a bare soil. Adjacent to the soil heat flux plates, soil thermal conductivity (λs) and temperature gradients were measured simultaneously with heat-pulse sensors, allowing Gz to be determined with the gradient method. The gradient method values were used as a standard to evaluate the performance of the heat flux plates. Temporal λs values were also estimated from soil sand content, bulk density and water content using a thermal conductivity model. At the 6- and 10-cm depths, the conventional plates underestimated Gz by 4.3–10.2Wm−2 due to heat flow distortion errors resulting from a mismatch between λs and plate thermal conductivity (λp). When the Philip correction was applied, both the measured and modeled λs values improved the accuracy of conventional heat flux plates. However, the modeling approach simplified the procedure for obtaining λs. The self-calibrating plate effectively corrected Gz errors associated with heat flow distortion (accurate to within 6.4Wm−2) at the 6cm and 10cm depths. At the 2cm depth, both types of plates produced erroneous Gz data, which were attributed to alterations in the thermal field and heat flux pattern around the plates due to blocking convective heat and water transfer. We also demonstrated that the heating process of the self-calibrating plate could bias Gz data by disturbing the heat flow field around the plate. Voltage signals during and shortly after self-calibration should be discarded from data analysis. With these corrections, heat flux plates can provide an effective method for measuring soil heat flux.},

	abstract = {Incoming radiation forcing at the land surface is partitioned among the components of the surface energy balance in varying proportions
depending on the time scale of the forcing. Based on a land-atmosphere analytic continuum model, a numerical land surface model, and field observations we show that high-frequency fluctuations in incoming radiation (with period less than 6 h, for example, due to intermittent clouds) are preferentially partitioned toward ground heat flux. These higher frequencies are concentrated in the 0-1 cm surface soil layer. Subsequently, measurements even at a few centimeters deep in the soil profile miss part of the surface soil heat flux signal. The attenuation of the high-frequency soil heat flux spectrum throughout the soil profile leads to systematic errors in both measurements and modeling, which require a very fine sampling near the soil surface (0-1 cm). Calorimetric measurement techniques introduce a systematic error in the form of an artificial band-pass filter if the temperature probes are not placed at appropriate depths. In addition, the temporal calculation of the change in the heat storage term of the calorimetric method can further distort the reconstruction of the surface soil heat flux signal. A correction methodology is introduced which provides practical
application as well as insights into the estimation of surface soil heat flux and the closure of surface energy balance based on field

	abstract = {Surface energy balance model is an essential approach for heat flux and evaporation estimation in applied meteorology and hydrology. Due to the complexity of soil–air interface system, the model has been simplified for different purposes in many researches. A complete model with full description of its complex factor relationships and its numerical solution has not been yet implemented in practical use. This paper presents a complete surface energy balance model with its inner relations cited from different researches. The model couples soil temperature change simultaneously with soil moisture movement, which makes the solution of the model uneasy. A detailed methodology of numerical approximation to the complete model is presented in the study for practical use. Soil heat and latent heat fluxes in the model are determined according to both soil temperature change and soil moisture movement, which are described as two differential equations. Crank–Nicolson implicit method is used to expand the differential equations into two sets of simultaneous linear equations, which are then solved by applying Gauss's elimination method. Latent heat flux is determined at the balance when evaporation from the surface is equal to the soil water loss. And surface temperature is estimated as the heat fluxes of the surface reaching the status of balance. The iterative computation of Newton–Raphson method is used to approximate latent heat flux and surface temperature from the balances. Based on this complexity of the model's relationships, a detailed computation procedure of the model is proposed. The methodology has been validated through application to south Israeli desert for heat flux and surface temperature estimation. A good matching of the simulated soil temperature to the measured one proves the validity of the model and method used for its numerical solution.},

The results suggest that the TI model (heat flux plate method) represents the observations better than the temperature-dependent one, which consistently overestimates soil heat flux at night and during the dusk-dawn period. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis reveals that the TD model is more sensitive to the selection of thermal conductivity and heat capacity values than the TI model.

	abstract = {The surface energy balance includes a term for soil heat flux. Soil heat flux is difficult to measure because it includes conduction and convection heat transfer processes. Accurate representation of soil heat flux is an important consideration in many modeling and measurement applications. Yet, there remains uncertainty about what comprises soil heat flux and how surface and subsurface heat fluxes are linked in energy balance closure. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the presence of a subsurface latent heat sink, which must be considered in order to accurately link subsurface heat fluxes between depths near and at the soil surface. Measurements were performed under effectively bare surface conditions in a silty clay loam soil near Ames, IA. Soil heat flux was measured with heat-pulse sensors using the gradient heat flux approach at 1-, 3-, and 6-cm soil depths. Independent estimates of the daily latent heat sink were obtained by measuring the change of mass of microlysimeters. Heat flux measurements at the 1-cm depth deviated from heat flux measurements at other depths, even after calorimetric adjustment was made. This deviation was most pronounced shortly after rainfall, where the 1-cm soil heat flux measurement exceeded 400Wm−2. Cumulative soil heat flux measurements at the 1-cm depth exceeded measurements at the 3-cm depth by {\textgreater}75\% over a 7-day rain-free period, whereas calorimetric adjustment allowed 3- and 6-cm depth measurements to converge. Latent heat sink estimates from the microlysimeters accounted for nearly all of the differences between the 1- and 3-cm depth heat flux measurements, indicating that the latent heat sink was distributed between the 1- and 3-cm depths shortly after the rainfall event. Results demonstrate the importance of including latent heat when attempts are made to link or extrapolate subsurface soil heat flux measurements to the surface soil heat flux.},

	abstract = {The standardized ASCE Penman–Monteith and FAO-56 equations were used to estimate reference evapotranspiration (ET0) using estimated and measured net radiation (Rn) and soil heat flux (G), based on hourly and daily meteorological data. The estimates were evaluated against lysimeter measurements. The results indicate that using measured or estimated values of Rn and G can have significant effect on the accuracy of the ET0 estimations, especially when calculations were made on an hourly basis. The FAO-56 version performed very well during the irrigation season on a daily basis. The use of measured Rn and G did not improve ET0 estimation on a daily basis, therefore, the use of estimated Rn and G appears to be dependable when calculations are based on 24-h weather data. When daily ET0 was calculated from hourly estimations, the results were different depending on the version used. The ASCE version was more accurate, especially when Rn and G were measured. Therefore, measurement of Rn and G may have potential to improve estimation only when daily ET0 is calculated from hourly estimations. The PM FAO-56 version was always a little less accurate than the ASCE version. For hourly calculations, using a constant surface resistance (as in FAO-56 version), the PM method underpredicted for high evaporative demand and vice versa. The ASCE version performed better than PM FAO-56 version when Rn and G were measured and estimated. Therefore, ASCE version tended to provide quite accurate values of hourly ET0, even using estimated values of Rn and G. As conclusion, the methods proposed by FAO-56 for estimating Rn and G tended to produce accurate estimates for daily and hourly ET0 under semiarid conditions and can be used with some degree of confidence for estimating ET0. In addition, results suggest that the ASCE standardized equation on an hourly basis improved the accuracy of ET0 estimation with respect to the FAO-56 version.},

	abstract = {Diffusive heat flux at the soil surface is commonly determined as a mean value over a time period using heat flux plates buried at some depth (e.g., 5–8cm) below the surface with a correction to surface flux based on the change in heat storage during the corresponding time period in the soil layer above the plates. The change in heat storage is based on the soil temperature change in the layer over the time period and an estimate of the soil thermal heat capacity that is based on soil water content, bulk density and organic matter content. One- or multiple-layer corrections using some measure of mean soil temperature over the layer depth are common; and in some cases the soil water content has been determined, although rarely. Several problems with the heat flux plate method limit the accuracy of soil heat flux values. An alternative method is presented and this flux gradient method is compared with soil heat flux plate measurements. The method is based on periodic (e.g., half-hourly) water content and temperature sensing at multiple depths within the soil profile and a solution of the Fourier heat flux equation. A Fourier sine series is fit to the temperature at each depth and the temperature at the next depth below is simulated with a sine series solution of the differential heat flux equation using successive approximation of the best fit based on changing the thermal diffusivity value. The best fit thermal diffusivity value is converted to a thermal conductivity value using the soil heat capacity, which is based on the measured water content and bulk density. A statistical analysis of the many data resulting from repeated application of this method is applied to describe the thermal conductivity as a function of water content and bulk density. The soil heat flux between each pair of temperature measurement depths is computed using the thermal conductivity function and measured water contents. The thermal gradient method of heat flux calculation compared well to values determined using heat flux plates and calorimetric correction to the soil surface; and it provided better representation of the surface spatiotemporal variation of heat flux and more accurate heat flux values. The overall method resulted in additional important knowledge including the water content dynamics in the near-surface soil profile and a soil-specific function relating thermal conductivity to soil water content and bulk density.},

	abstract = {Soil heat flux at the surface (G0) is strongly influenced by whether the soil is shaded or sunlit, and therefore can have large spatial variability for incomplete vegetation cover, such as across the interrows of row crops. Most practical soil–plant–atmosphere energy balance models calculate G0 as a function of either total (RN) or soil net radiation (RN,S). Even though RN,S includes sunlit and shaded conditions, this is seldom considered, even at spatial scales of a few m. In order to improve the utility of surface energy balance models designed for row crops at relatively small spatial scales, a method was developed to calculate G0 as a function of shaded, partially sunlit, or fully sunlit RN,S. Calculation of RN,S was derived using a geometric approach, and G0 was derived by the calorimetric method using measurements of soil temperature and volumetric soil water content under upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) over a wide range of canopy cover conditions. Calorimetric G0 and calculated RN,S were related by assuming their normalized values were equal at 24h time steps and in phase. The method required only a single empirical parameter, which related the 24h minimum G0 (G0,MIN) to the 24h maximum RN,S (RN,S,MAX) as G0,MIN=a×RN,S,MAX, and a=−0.31 was found by simple linear regression (p{\textless}0.01). Model sensitivity (SM) of calculated G0 was calculated for sparse, medium, and full canopy cover; nighttime, shaded, partially sunlit, and fully sunlit surface conditions; and north–south and east–west row orientations, where input values of agronomic, shortwave, and longwave input variables were varied ±25\% of their base values. The method was most sensitive (1.0{\textless}SM{\textless}36) to canopy width, canopy height, leaf area index, row spacing, canopy and soil emittances, and canopy and soil temperatures for medium to full canopy cover. Also, there was generally greater sensitivity for shaded and partially sunlit surfaces compared with sunlit and nighttime surfaces, and north–south rows compared with east–west rows. However, the method had little sensitivity (SM usually {\textless}0.50) to input variables used to calculate the shortwave components of RN,S.},

	abstract = {The quantity and percent cover of a crop residue in no-tillage (NT) affects the transmission of radiation through the residue layer and alters soil heat flux compared with conventional moldboard tillage (CT). It has been shown that NT results in cold soil temperature and reduced germination. A residue-free strip over the center of planting row can improve the thermal regime of NT but, limited information has been published on the potential changes in heat flux density in no-tillage soil with different residue management practices. Therefore, we conducted a study on simulated NT plots (with no crop) in 1986 and 1987 to evaluate the impact of tillage and residue-free strips in NT practices on heat flux density of soil-residue systems on Plano silt loam soil. The treatments were NT with a 0.31 kg m−2 residue areal density with 5 (NT5), 15 (NT15), and 30 cm (NT30) wide: residue-free strips. These treatments were compared with 0.61 kg m−2 residue areal density with 15 (NT′15) and 30 cm (NT′30) wide residue-free strips. A second large field-scale (including crop) experiment was conducted in 1987 and 1988, where: the NT30 and NT5 were compared with CT. Heat fluxes for soil and soil residue systems were measured or calculated from 1986 to 1988. In the simulated NT study, soil surface heat flux (Gss) in the center of the residue-free strip and conductive (Gmr), and conductive (Gma) heat flux at 15 cm away from the center of the residue-free strip across the residue layer were significantly greater in the NT30 than in the other treatments. Increases in Gs, Gmr and Gma of NT30 compared with NT5, NT′15 and NT15 were associated with increased temperature in-the-row and between-the-row at the soil surface and :5 cm depth. In the large field-scale study, the G. was within the range of -123.1 to 313.4 W m-2 in CT, −101.3 to 247.1 W m−2 in NT30 and −69.8 to 209.1 W m−2 in NT5 for 0−5 cm soil layer during 8–21 May 1987 and 1988. The Gmr values at 15 cm away from the row center were significantly greater in treatments with 0.31 kg m−2 residue areal density than in treatments with 0.62 kg m−2 residue areal density. The Gma in NT30 and NT′30 were significantly greater than in NT15, NT′n15 and NT5. The 15 and 30 cm residue-free strips in NT30, NT′30, NT15 and NT′15 displayed greater heat input into the soil surface than the NT5 system. There was more heat input into the soil surface in no-tillage soil with residue-free strips in the spring which conserves soil and water because of a layer of the residue maintained between-the-rows. These modified residue management systems could prove beneficial for early spring plant germination in cold regions.},

	abstract = {It is generally accepted that the ground heat flux accounts for a significant fraction of the surface energy balance. In land surface models, the ground heat flux is typically estimated through a numerical solution of the heat conduction equation. Recent research has shown that this approach introduces errors in the estimation of the energy balance. In this paper, we calibrate a land surface model using a numerical solution of the heat conduction equation with four different vertical spatial resolutions. It is found that the thermal conductivity is the most sensitive parameter to the spatial resolution. More importantly, the thermal conductivity values are directly related to the spatial resolution, thus rendering any physical interpretation of this value irrelevant. The numerical solution is then replaced by an analytical solution. The results of the numerical and analytical solutions are identical when fine spatial and temporal resolutions are used. However, when using resolutions that are typical of land surface models, significant differences are found. When using the analytical solution, the ground heat flux is directly calculated without calculating the soil temperature profile. The calculation of the temperature at each node in the soil profile is thus no longer required, unless the model contains parameters that depend on the soil temperature, which in this study is not the case. The calibration is repeated, and thermal conductivity values independent of the vertical spatial resolution are obtained. The main conclusion of this study is that care must be taken when interpreting land surface model results that have been obtained using numerical ground heat flux estimates. The use of exact analytical solutions, when available, is recommended.},

This study presents initial findings related to the development of both analytical and numerical tools to represent various components of such inter-seasonal heat storage facilities. In particular two aspects are considered; firstly the use of widely available averaged meteorological data to be employed in an analytical solution of a simplified version of the problem and secondly the use of a more comprehensive finite element solution to explore the detailed thermal response of the ground in terms of seasonal energy storage. Initial comparisons against field measurements from a large scale demonstration project (undertaken by others) are presented and preliminary conclusions related to the key factors affecting the representation of the surface boundary condition made. The analytical approach developed appears to offer a representative and practical way of estimating initial conditions for both initial assessment of potential for energy collection and storage and for use in defining initial conditions in any subsequent numerical analysis of a detailed inter-seasonal heat storage facility.},

The objective of this study is to evaluate the capability of optical and thermal information to quantify Gs and ET in the frame of the Penman-Monteith model. We evaluated the three remote sensing data-based retrievals of daily Gs and ET using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data and eddy covariance measurements at three sites in the North China Plain. The Gs models were established on the basis of (1) single vegetation index (VI), including normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and enhanced vegetation index (EVI), (2) temperature vegetation dryness index (TVDI), and (3) combination of VI and TVDI. The results demonstrated that the combination of NDVI and theoretical TVDI achieved the best accuracy of quantifying Gs and ET. The single VI-based model also performed well. The empirical TVDI-based model failed to estimate Gs and ET since there existed significant uncertainties in the calculation of the dry and wet edge. In contrast, the theoretical TVDI with an apparent seasonal pattern was of more value to acquire Gs and ET due to its explicit physical mechanism. From this study, the combination of VI and TVDI, as well as single VI, were recommended to build alternative approaches to acquiring ET. These Gs models highly rely on remote sensing data and thus show promising potential in regional-scale application.},

In order to understand the characteristics of soil heat flux and to examine the performances of the two methods, a field experiment was conducted at a temperate and humid grassland in Cork, Ireland. Our results show that the soil heat flux had the same magnitude as the sensible heat flux at this grassland site. It was also demonstrated that the analytical method did not predict the soil heat flux well because the sinusoidal assumption for the temporal variation in soil heat flux was invalid. In contrast, good agreement was found between the soil heat flux measurements and predictions made by the half-order time derivative method.

The approach is a variational data assimilation approach that uses the applied measurements to optimize, on a daily basis, parameter values of a model that describes the heat transport between the vegetation canopy and the surface and within the soil column. Insertion of error characteristics that either are inferred from the field data themselves or are derived from literature leads to valid estimates of the cost function for about 100 days in 2003. The approach gives values of the model parameters that compare well to values derived from the literature, although values for the soil conductivity and the volumetric heat capacity of the soil start to differ from the literature values at the end of 2003, possibly because of specific soil characteristics and the extreme dryness of the summer of 2003. The model gives estimates of the surface soil heat flux that compare well to estimates using the currently operational lambda approach, provided that the latter is adapted to account for the disturbance of the soil heat flux at the locations of the heat flux plates. Only when the surface soil heat flux is very small or very large does the new approach give estimates of the surface soil heat flux that differ from those obtained with the lambda approach.},

	abstract = {There are no direct methods to evaluate calculated soil heat flux (SHF) at the surface (G0). Instead, validation and cross evaluation of methods for calculating G0 usually rely on the conventional calorimetric method or the degree of the surface energy balance closure. However, there is uncertainty in the calorimetric method itself, and factors apart from G0 also contribute to nonclosure of the surface energy balance. Here we used a novel approach to evaluate nine different methods for calculating SHF, including the calorimetric method and methods based on analytical solutions of the heat diffusion equation. The SHF (Gz) measured by a self-calibrating SHF plate at a depth of z = 5 cm below the surface (hereafter Gm\_5cm) was deployed as a reference. Each SHF calculation method was assessed by comparing the calculated Gz at the same depth (hereafter Gc\_5cm) with Gm\_5cm. The calorimetric method and simple measurement method performed best in determining Gc\_5cm but still underestimated Gm\_5cm by 19\% during the daytime. Possible causes for this underestimation include errors and uncertainties in SHF measurements and soil thermal properties, as well as the phase lag between Gc\_5cm and Gm\_5cm. Our results indicate that the calorimetric method achieves the most accurate SHF estimates if self-calibrating SHF plates are deployed at two depths (e.g., 5 cm and 10 cm), soil temperature and water content measurements are made in a few depths between the two plates, and soil thermal properties are accurately quantified.},

On the basis of a data set recorded during the LITFASS-2003 experiment, the strengths and weaknesses of the approaches are assessed. The quality of the best approaches (simpliﬁed measurement and forcerestore) approximates that of the measured data set. An approach calculating the ground heat ﬂux from net radiation and the diurnal amplitude of the soil surface temperature also delivers satisfactory daytime results. The remaining approaches all have such serious drawbacks that they should only be applied with care. Altogether, this study demonstrates that ground heat ﬂux parameterization has the potential to produce results matching measured ones very well, if all conditions and restrictions of the respective approaches are taken into account.},

	abstract = {Soil heat ﬂux is an important component of the surface energy balance (SEB) equation. Measuring it requires an indirect measurement. Every used technique may present some possible errors tied with the utilized speciﬁc technique, soil inhomogeneities, or physical phenomena such as latent heat conversion beneath the plates, especially in desiccation cracking soil or vertisol. The installation place may also induce imbalances. Finally, some errors resulting from the physical sensor presence, vegetation presence, or soil inhomogeneities may occur and are not avoidable. For all these reasons it is important to check the validity of the measurements. A quick and easy way is to integrate results over 1 year. By consideration of the inert core internal energy conservation law, it is shown that the corresponding integration should be close to zero after a necessary geothermal heat efﬂux subtraction. However, below-plate evaporation and vegetation-absorbed water or rainwater inﬁltration may also contribute to the observed short-scale and/or longscale imbalance generating convective heat ﬂuxes not sensed by the heat ﬂux sensors. Another energy source is usually not included in the SEB equation: rainfall or irrigation. Yet its importance for short- and long-term integration is notable. As an example, the most used sensor, soil heat ﬂux plates (SHFPs), is given.},

	abstract = {The surface energy imbalance, viz. that the turbulent dissipation does not fully account for available energy, has for long been an outstanding challenge in geophysical studies. In this study, we developed a novel approach based on nonequilibrium thermodynamics by representing the atmospheric boundary layer as a heat engine. In addition, an analytically tractable approach was used to estimate the ground heat ﬂux based on Green's function approach, which in turn determines the available energy that drives the atmospheric heat engine. The proposed model was evaluated using heat ﬂuxes measured by eight AmeriFlux eddy covariance towers with atmospheric temperature proﬁles recorded at adjacent radiosonde sites. The surface energy balance closure can be improved by {\textasciitilde}11\% over various landscapes, by including the estimated power production from the atmospheric heat engine. Plain Language Summary We present in this study a novel approach that sheds new lights on the outstanding challenge of land surface energy imbalance problem, by treating the atmospheric boundary layer as a nonequilibrium heat engine. The production of mechanical work within ﬁnite time through the atmospheric heat engine is found to contribute signiﬁcantly to the energy residual responsible for the imbalance. We applied the model to ﬁeld measurements using ﬂux towers and a radiosonde stations and were capable of recovering signiﬁcant missing land surface energy. The proposed method therefore provides a promising new perspective to improve the surface energy closure.},

	abstract = {Most conventional numerical schemes for soil ground heat ﬂux estimation rely on the knowledge of the temporal evolution of soil temperature. Here we propose and test a novel scheme, which requires no information on soil temperatures to supplement the ﬂux plate measurement. The proposed method is based on the fundamental solution of the one-dimensional heat equation and Duhamel’s principle for the incorporation of inhomogeneous boundary conditions. Being completely independent of the soil temperature, the new scheme therefore avoids a potential source of error in measurements and in heat storage calculation. The only thermal property involved in the new scheme is the thermal diffusivity of the soil, which is a weak function of soil water content and can be approximated as constant with reasonable accuracy. For validation, the proposed method is compared to the conventional approach using a canonical one-dimensional heat conduction problem, as well as real ﬁeld measurements. Results of the comparison highlight that the new model is robust and capable of preserving the good accuracy of the conventional approach with reduced input information. In addition, the effect of inclusion of the heat storage term in the ground heat ﬂux is evaluated in the context of surface energy balance closure for ﬁeld measurements.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a novel method that allows the diurnal variation of ground heat ﬂux to be computed from the corresponding time series measurement of surface soil temperature. Soil temperature and soil heat ﬂux over time at one location are uniquely related through a half-order derivative/integral operator when heat transfer in a soil matrix is described by a onedimensional diffusion equation with a constant diffusivity parameter. Both simulated and observed data have been used to test the method. The case study suggests that the derived relationships between soil heat ﬂux and soil temperature under idealized conditions provide satisfactory approximations for practical purposes. Close agreement of the estimated variables with observations indicates that this proposed method is promising. Its potential applications include the estimation of the regional energy balance at the land surface using remote sensing observations. q 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Persistent concern regarding surface energy balance closure encourages increased scrutiny of potential sources of error. Laboratory and field experiments addressed heat flow distortion and thermal contact resistance errors during measurement of soil heat flux (G) using the flux plate technique. Steady-state, one-dimensional heat flow experiments determined flux plate thermal conductivities (lambda m) and measured the effect of air gaps and thermal heat sink coatings on plate performance. Use of measured instead of manufacturer-specified lambda m and plate dimensions in a heat flow distortion correction improved the consistency but not the average disagreement between imposed sand G and corrected plate heat flux density (Gm). Consistent underestimates of G in dry sand by 20 to 25\% after heat flow distortion correction was attributed to thermal contact resistance effects. A convex air gap 0.1 to 1.32 mm thick across 5.9\% of the plate face area reduced Gm by up to 9.7\%. A thin layer of a thermal heat sink compound with lambda 0.18 W m-1 K-1 greater than the plate lambda m (1.0 W m-1 K-1) did not increase Gm in a clay soil but increased Gm by approximately 6\% in quartz sand. A 6.5\% increase in Gm was also observed for plates treated with the same heat sink compound in a silt loam soil under field conditions. Thermal contact resistance errors are probably {\textless}10\% in moist, medium-textured soils and can be minimized by careful plate installation. Relatively greater errors in Gm may occur due to thermal contact resistance in dry sand and due to heat flow distortion when soil lambda {\textgreater}{\textgreater} lambda m.},
