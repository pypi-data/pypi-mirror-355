# Glu CLI

![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/glu-cli)

Glu CLI is a command‑line interface for Glu that streamlines common development workflows by integrating 
GitHub pull requests, Jira tickets, and AI‑powered content generation.

## Installation

Glu CLI is distributed via PyPI. You can install it with:

```bash
pipx install glu-cli
```

Alternatively, to install from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrightNight-Energy/glu.git
cd glu
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

After installation, the `glu` command will be available:

```bash
glu --help
```

### Commands

Glu CLI provides two main command groups: `pr` and `ticket`. They are registered as subcommands of the main CLI:

```bash
glu pr --help
glu ticket --help
```

#### `pr create`

The only command you need. When you're ready to push and raise a PR, use this. It will:

1. Create your commit message based on commit diff (if uncommitted changes)
2. Create a ticket in Jira based on PR description (or use the provided ticket #)
3. Push a PR based on the git diff and tag your reviewers
4. If PR is not a draft, will move your ticket to Ready for review!

...all fully customizable and within your control.
