           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

[![static analysis workflow](https://github.com/innatelogic/logicsponge-processmining/actions/workflows/static-analysis.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/innatelogic/logicsponge-processmining/actions/workflows/static-analysis.yaml/)


**logicsponge-processmining** is a library for process-mining tasks that is built on **logicsponge-core**. Process mining involves a set of tools for modeling, analyzing, and improving business processes.

# In a nutshell

The current implementation includes the following features:
- Event-log prediction in both batch and streaming modes, using frequency prefix trees, n-grams, LSTMs, and ensemble methods.
- Visualization of event streams based on their prefix trees.

# Getting started

We recommend starting with our [logicsponge tutorial](https://github.com/innatelogic/logicsponge) to get acquainted with the basics of how logicsponge processes data streams.   Afterwards, to get started with logicsponge-processmining, install it using pip:

```sh
pip install logicsponge-processmining
```

# Event-log prediction

Event-log prediction involves anticipating events given historical data about a process. In the streaming case, we receive a sequence of events, where each event is a pair
(case ID, activity) consisting of a case ID and an activity (also referred to as action). As events arrive, we train a model incrementally, allowing it to predict the next activity for a given case based on
the sequence of activities observed so far.

logicsponge-processmining offers several predefined models: frequency prefix trees, n-grams, LSTMs, and ensemble methods (soft, hard, and adaptive voting).

Let’s walk through the required imports to understand the structure of the library:

```python
# example.py

import logicsponge.core as ls
from logicsponge.processmining.algorithms_and_structures import Bag, FrequencyPrefixTree, NGram
from logicsponge.processmining.models import BasicMiner, SoftVoting
from logicsponge.processmining.streaming import IteratorStreamer, StreamingActivityPredictor
from logicsponge.processmining.test_data import dataset
```

This imports algorithms like frequency prefix trees and n-grams. These classes also allow you to define your own data structures.

You will then import models:
- `BasicMiner` wraps a single algorithm (e.g., an n-gram) to produce a predictor model.
- `SoftVoting` (and other ensemble methods) takes a list of models and produces a new model that applies soft voting.

Instances of these classes are ready for batch learning. To use them in streaming mode, wrap them with `StreamingActivityPredictor`. Below, we define two models:
- The first is a 6-gram (look-back window size of 5).
- The second combines several algorithms using soft voting.

By configuring `"include_stop": False`, stop predictions are ignored, and probabilities are normalized. This is often suitable in streaming settings unless explicit stop activities are present.

```python
config = {
    "include_stop": False,
}

model1 = StreamingActivityPredictor(
    strategy=BasicMiner(algorithm=NGram(window_length=5), config=config),
)

model2 = StreamingActivityPredictor(
    strategy=SoftVoting(
        models=[
            BasicMiner(algorithm=Bag()),
            BasicMiner(algorithm=FrequencyPrefixTree(min_total_visits=10)),
            BasicMiner(algorithm=NGram(window_length=2)),
            BasicMiner(algorithm=NGram(window_length=3)),
            BasicMiner(algorithm=NGram(window_length=4)),
        ],
        config=config,
    )
)
```

Next, we set up the sponge to stream data from a dataset and apply a model. For clarity, a key filter is applied first.  

The dataset can be any iterator. For illustration, we use the **Sepsis dataset** available at [4TU.ResearchData](https://data.4tu.nl/datasets/33632f3c-5c48-40cf-8d8f-2db57f5a6ce7). When you run the Python script, you will be prompted to download it.


```python
streamer = IteratorStreamer(data_iterator=dataset)

sponge = (
    streamer
    * ls.KeyFilter(keys=["case_id", "activity", "timestamp"])
    * model2
    * ls.AddIndex(key="index", index=1)
    * ls.Print()
)


sponge.start()
```

A single prediction might look like this. In addition to the actual case_id and activity, it provides:
- The most likely predicted activity.
- The top-3 activities.
- The probability distribution over all possible activities.

```python
{
    'case_id': 'FAA',
    'activity': 'Return ER',
    'prediction': {
        'activity': 'Return ER',
        'top_k_actions': ['Return ER', 'Leucocytes', 'Release E'],
        'probability': 0.9986388006307096,
        'probs': {
            # [...]
            'Leucocytes': 0.0013611993692904283,
            'Return ER': 0.9986388006307096,
            # [...]
        }
    },
    'latency': 0.06985664367675781,
    'index': 15214
}
```
