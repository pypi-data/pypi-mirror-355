# ASPSIM : Audio signal processing simulator

## Introduction
The package simulates sound in a reverberant space. The simulator supports moving microphones and moving sources. The simulator supports adaptive processing, where the sound of the sources are determined by the sound in the room. This is useful for instance for active noise control and similar adaptive processing tasks. 

The package currently uses the image-source method implementation of [Pyroomacoustics](https://github.com/LCAV/pyroomacoustics) to generate the room impulse responses.
