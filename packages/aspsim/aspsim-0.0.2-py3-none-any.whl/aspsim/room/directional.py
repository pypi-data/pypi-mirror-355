def differential_cardioid_microphone(signal_main, signal_secondary, microphone_distance, filter_order, c, samplerate, filter_below=None):
    """Constructs a cardioid microphone response from two omnidirectional microphones
    
    The two omnidirectional microphones must be separated by a distance of microphone_distance.
    The strongest response is in the direction of the main microphone from the secondary, and the null is in the opposite direction.

    Parameters
    ----------
    signal_main : ndarray of shape (num_mics, num_samples)
        the signal from the main microphone
    signal_secondary : ndarray of shape (num_mics, num_samples)
        the signal from the secondary microphone
    microphone_distance : float
        the distance between the microphones
    filter_order : int
        the order of the filter. The filter will have 2*filter_order + 1 taps. 
    c : float
        the speed of sound. 
    samplerate : int
        the sampling rate of the signals. 
    filter_below : float or None
        if not None, filters out the frequencies below this frequency, given in Hertz. The differential microphone
        is problematic at low frequencies, and this can be used to avoid this.

    Returns
    -------
    cardioid_signal : ndarray of shape (num_mics, num_samples)
        the signal from the cardioid microphone
