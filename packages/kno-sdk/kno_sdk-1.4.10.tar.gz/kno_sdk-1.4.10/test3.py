    ## Security Issues
    
    ### [1] üîê JWT Secret Hardcoding (High Risk)
    _File: src/auth/constants.ts_
    
    ```typescript
    export const jwtConstants = {
      secret: 'g5sfljha454sdas6fsf4dasf8',
    };
    ```
    
    #### Vulnerability Details
    - **Risk Level**: High
    - **Impact**: 
      - Potential token forgery
      - Security key exposed in source code
      - Easy compromise if repository is leaked
    
    #### Suggested Fix
    1. Use environment variables for secret management
    2. Never commit secrets to version control
    3. Implement secure secret rotation
    
    ```typescript
    // Recommended approach
    export const jwtConstants = {
      secret: process.env.JWT_SECRET,
    };
    ```
    
    ### [2] üõ°Ô∏è Authentication Mechanism Weaknesses
    _File: src/auth/auth.guard.ts_
    
    #### Vulnerability Details
    - Insufficient authentication validation
    - Potential security bypass risks
    - Weak token verification mechanisms
    
    #### Suggested Fix
    1. Implement robust token validation
    2. Add comprehensive authentication middleware
    3. Use strong, cryptographically secure validation methods
    
    ## Recommendations
    
    ### Immediate Actions
    1. Replace hardcoded JWT secret immediately
    2. Generate strong, random secrets
    3. Implement environment-based configuration
    4. Enhance authentication middleware
    5. Conduct thorough security review
    
    ### Long-term Security Strategies
    - Regular security audits
    - Implement multi-factor authentication
    - Use industry-standard authentication libraries
    - Continuous security training for development team
    
    ## Compliance and Best Practices
    
    ‚úÖ Positive Findings:
    - `.gitignore` correctly excludes `.env` files
    - Indicates awareness of basic secret management
    
    ## Conclusion
    
    The identified vulnerabilities pose significant security risks. Immediate action is required to mitigate potential unauthorized access and protect sensitive application data.
