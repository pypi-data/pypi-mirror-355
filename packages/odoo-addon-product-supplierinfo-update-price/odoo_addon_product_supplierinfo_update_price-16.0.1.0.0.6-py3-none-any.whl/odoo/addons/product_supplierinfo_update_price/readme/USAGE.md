To use this module, you need to:

- Go to Purchase > New Purchase

- Set the supplier and add a purchase order line with a product and its price

- If the price of the product on the purchase order line for that supplier is different from the price set in the product's vendor list (on the purchase tab), or if no vendor entry exists, a refresh button will appear to the right of the unit price. Otherwise, the button will not be shown.

- If you click the refresh button, the vendor price will be updated or a new vendor entry will be created, as appropriate.
