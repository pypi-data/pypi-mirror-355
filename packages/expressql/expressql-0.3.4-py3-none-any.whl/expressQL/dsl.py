    A basic condition is made of expressions and a comparison operator.

    Compound conditions are made of basic conditions and logical operators.

    Constructs a primary key condition for a SQL query.
    This function generates a composite SQL condition by combining

                      used in a query to filter rows based on the
                      primary key.
