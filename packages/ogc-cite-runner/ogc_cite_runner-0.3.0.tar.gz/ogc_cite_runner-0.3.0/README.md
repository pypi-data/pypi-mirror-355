# ogc-cite-runner

Simplify testing your OGC implementation server against [CITE](https://github.com/opengeospatial/cite/wiki). This
repository contains an OGC CITE runner that can be called as a github action. It can also be used standalone,
which allows integration with other CI platforms or running locally.
