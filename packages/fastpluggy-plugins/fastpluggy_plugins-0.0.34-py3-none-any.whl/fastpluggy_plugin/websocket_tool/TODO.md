Let me know if you want to:

Kick clients manually from this page (add a "disconnect" button)
Track when they connected or last seen
Broadcast test messages from here


last_seen timestamp tracking per client (for disconnection/cleanup logic)
A small heartbeat mechanism (e.g. type="ping"/pong) to monitor liveness
Optional client authorization/token-based identity
