Generate requirements for creating Anki models based on the given deck requirements and available fields.

{{block requirement "Deck Requirements"}}

{{block (ls fields) "Available Fields"}}

## Task
Based on the deck requirements and available fields above, generate a list of specific model generation requirements. Each requirement should describe a distinct type of card model that would be useful for this deck.

Consider:
- Different learning approaches (recognition, recall, comprehension, application)
- Various question formats (basic Q&A, cloze deletion, multiple choice concepts)
- Different difficulty levels or complexity
- Specialized formats for the subject matter
- Interactive or multi-step learning patterns

Each model requirement should be concise but specific enough to guide the creation of a focused card model with appropriate templates.
