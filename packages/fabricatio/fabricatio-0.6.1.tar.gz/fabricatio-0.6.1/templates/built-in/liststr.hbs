# Example:
Requirement: break down this requirement below to multiple smaller but descriptive sub requirements
"When citing other articles as references in a text, follow the format `(Author1, Author2 et al., Year)#cite(<bibtex_cite_key>)`. Typst is used to generate numeric citations, where each BibTeX key (e.g., `YanWindEnergy2018`) must be enclosed in angle brackets `<` and `>` within the `#cite()` command (e.g., `#cite(<YanWindEnergy2018>)`), which compiles to a superscript number like [1]. Since `#cite()` only references a single文献 at a time, multiple citations (e.g., three keys: `YanWindEnergy2018`, `YanWindEnergy2019`, `YanWindEnergy2020`) require stacking individual `#cite()` tags: `#cite(<YanWindEnergy2018>)#cite(<YanWindEnergy2019>)#cite(<YanWindEnergy2020>)`, resulting in [1,2,3]. To enhance reference coverage, similar studies should be grouped into a single citation whenever possible. Note that omitting angle brackets around BibTeX keys will cause compiler errors."

[
"When citing references in an article, strictly follow the format `(Author1, Author2 et al., Year)#cite(<BibTeX_key>)`: list the first three authors followed by 'et al.' if there are more than three; use four-digit years (e.g., 2020); and ensure `#cite()` immediately follows the author/year text with the BibTeX key enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `(Smith, Johnson et al., 2020)#cite(<SmithClimate2020>)`).",
"Use Typst's `#cite(<BibTeX_key>)` for numeric citations (e.g., `#cite(<YanWindEnergy2018>)`). This produces a superscript number (e.g., [1]). Ensure BibTeX files are correctly linked to the document path; Typst numbers citations in the order they appear in the text. Errors in paths may cause missing references.",
"For multiple citations, stack `#cite()` tags consecutively (e.g., `#cite(<YanWindEnergy2018>)#cite(<YanWindEnergy2019>)`). No text or spaces can separate them. Compilation merges them into a comma-separated list (e.g., [1,2,3]), preserving their textual order.",
"Merge citations of thematically related works (e.g., `[1,2,3]`) to maximize reference coverage. Merge criteria include: successive studies by the same team, methodological comparisons in the same field, or complementary conclusions. Avoid merging unrelated or contradictory studies.",
"Require `#cite()` keys to be enclosed in `<` and `>`. Omitting brackets causes compilation errors like `Error: Invalid citation format`. Fix by verifying angle brackets and recompiling."
