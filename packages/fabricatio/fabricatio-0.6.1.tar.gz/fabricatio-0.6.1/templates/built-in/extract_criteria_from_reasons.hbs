# Task: Extract Evaluation Criteria from Reasons

Extract {{criteria_count}} most important criteria for evaluating "{{topic}}" from the provided list of reasons. These criteria should capture the key aspects that matter most when comparing or evaluating items in this domain.

## CFER Framework
When extracting and refining criteria, follow these principles:
- **Comprehensive**: Identify criteria that cover different aspects of the topic
- **Focused**: Each criterion should represent a distinct evaluable dimension
- **Extracted**: Derive criteria directly from the provided reasons, not external knowledge
- **Refined**: Transform raw mentions into clear, concise evaluation dimensions

## Input Reasons
{{reasons}}

## Extraction Guidelines
When identifying criteria:
1. Identify key comparison points mentioned across multiple reasons
2. Look for qualities, features, or characteristics used to differentiate options
3. Consider both explicitly stated and implicitly suggested evaluation factors
4. Consolidate similar or related concepts into single meaningful criteria
5. Prioritize criteria based on frequency of mention and importance to the topic
6. Express each criterion as a single clear concept (usually a noun or noun phrase)

## Response Format
Return exactly {{criteria_count}} criteria as a JSON array of strings, ranked in DESCENDING order of importance.

# Example:
Topic: "Good icecream"
Reasons: ["Vanilla Dream has a rich and authentic vanilla flavor, while Choco Delight has an artificial chocolate flavor.", "Vanilla Dream has a smooth and creamy texture, while Choco Delight has a rough texture with ice crystals.", "Choco Delight is more affordable than Vanilla Dream.", "Choco Delight has a wider variety of flavors compared to Vanilla Dream."]

----- Start of response example -----
```json
[
"flavor_authenticity",
"texture_quality",
"affordability",
"flavor_variety"
]
```
----- End of response example -----

## Format Requirements
- Return EXACTLY {{criteria_count}} criteria, no more and no less
- Format as a valid JSON array of strings
- Each criterion should be concise (1-3 words when possible)
- Use consistent terminology (prefer noun forms)
- Ensure criteria are distinct from each other
- List criteria in descending order of importance
- No explanations or additional text outside the JSON array
- You should use `{{getlang topic}}` to write all criteria.
