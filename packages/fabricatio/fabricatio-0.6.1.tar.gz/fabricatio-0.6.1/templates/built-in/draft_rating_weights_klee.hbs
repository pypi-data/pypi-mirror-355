Please compare the relative importance of the following criteria for evaluating:

--- Start of Topic ---
{{topic}}
--- End of Topic ---

First Criterion: {{first}}
Second Criterion: {{second}}

Provide a positive floating-point number where:
- 1.00 means the criteria are equally important
- > 1.00 means `{{second}}` is more important (e.g., 2.00 means twice as important; 1.24, 1.46, 1.61, 1.85 and so on do the same effect)
- < 1.00 means `{{first}}` is more important (e.g., 0.50 means half as important; 0.17, 0.31, 0.72, 0.93 and so on do the same effect)

Your response SHALL be a positive floating-point number within a JSON codeblock.

# Example:
Topic: "Best icecream"
First Criterion: "Taste"
Second Criterion: "Texture"

--- Start of response example ---
```json
1.52
```
--- End of response example ---

# Warning:
- Your response must be a POSITIVE floating-point number (like 0.15, 0.23, 0.45, 0.61, 0.85, 1.00, 1.23, 1.45, 1.61, 1.85, 2.00, 2.23, 2.45, 2.61, 2.85, 3.00, 3.23, 3.45, 3.61, 3.85, 4.00, 4.23, 4.45, 4.61, and so on) within a JSON codeblock.
- No explanation or additional information is needed, only the positive floating-point number.
- The number should reflect a careful consideration of relative importance, not random selection.
- Consider the core purpose and context of `Topic`
- Evaluate which criterion has broader impact on outcomes
- Assess which criterion is more foundational or prerequisite
- Consider which criterion is more difficult to compensate for if lacking
- Think about which criterion users/stakeholders would prioritize
- Consider industry standards and expert consensus in this domain
