This is a chapter of my thesis document.
I need to create a Chapter summary for this chapter.

1. What is a "Chapter Summary"?
A "Chapter Summary" is a concise synthesis and distillation of the key content from the chapter, presented by the author.

2. Characteristics of Writing a "Chapter Summary"
First, "Conciseness." It should briefly summarize the chapter’s core content, align with the research thread, maintain strong relevance, and exhibit logical coherence.
Second, "Brevity." The summary must be succinct, typically around 500 words.

3. Content of a "Chapter Summary"
A "Chapter Summary" generally includes:
- Introduction
- Research findings
- Main research content and methodology
- Future prospects

"Research findings" and "research content" are essential components. For literature reviews, "research findings" may be omitted.
Optional elements such as "introduction," "methodology," and "future prospects" can be included based on context.

Key Considerations:
(1) Avoid using the term "本章" (this chapter) in the text except in headings.
(2) Refrain from vague or insubstantial statements.
(3) Maintain a formal tone and avoid colloquial language.


The summary should be written in {{{paragraph_count}}} paragraphs.
approximately {{{summary_word_count}}} words in total, without mentioning any exact statistics.
You MUST use '{{language}}' as written language, your response shall have no extra explanation.
