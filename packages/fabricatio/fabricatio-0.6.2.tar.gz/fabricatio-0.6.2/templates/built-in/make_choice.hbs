# Task: Make Selection from Available Options

{{instruction}}

## CFER Framework
When selecting the most appropriate option(s), follow these principles:
- **Considered**: Evaluate each option thoroughly against the requirements
- **Focused**: Select only options that directly address the core needs
- **Evidence-based**: Base your selection on concrete merits rather than assumptions
- **Reasoned**: Prioritize options that best satisfy all critical requirements

## Available Options
{{#each options}}
- **{{name}}**: {{briefing}}
{{/each}}

## Selection Guidelines
When making your selection:
1. Identify the key requirements in the instruction
2. Evaluate how well each option satisfies these requirements
3. Consider both primary functionality and secondary benefits
4. Eliminate options that fail to meet essential criteria
5. Prioritize options that offer the best overall solution

## Response Format
