# Task
Please draft a rating manual for the following topic and criteria. This manual will guide evaluators in applying consistent standards.

Topic: {{ topic }}
Criteria: {{ criteria }}

Return the rating manual as a JSON object within a codeblock where the keys are the criteria and the values are the detailed descriptions for each criterion.

# Example:

Topic: Nice icecream
Criteria: ["nice outlook","good taste","good texture"]
----- Start of response example -----
```json
{
"nice outlook": "Appearance of the icecream, how it looks. High score for an ice cream with a beautiful appearance such as vibrant color combinations and topped with fresh fruits or chocolate pieces; low score for an ice cream that looks unappealing, possibly showing signs of melting or covered in ice crystals.",
"good taste": "How the icecream tastes. High score for delicious ice cream with rich and authentic flavors, like vanilla with natural vanilla bean aroma and moderate sweetness; low score for bland or overly sweet ice cream with noticeable artificial flavoring or not matching its claimed flavor.",
"good texture": "How the icecream feels. High score for smooth texture without icy bits, melts smoothly in the mouth providing a creamy experience; low score for rough texture containing many ice crystals, feeling like it has been frozen for too long lacking softness."
}
```
----- End of response example -----

## Aspect Introduction
For each criterion in your manual:
- Provide a clear definition of what the criterion measures
- Include specific examples of high-quality and low-quality manifestations
- Define observable characteristics evaluators should look for
- Use domain-appropriate terminology
- Ensure the description enables consistent application across different instances

# Warning
- Please ensure that the rating manual is clear and concise, and that the criteria for each criterion are well-defined.
- The response SHALL be returned as a JSON object within the codeblock.
- No additional explanation is needed.
- All keys in the json must include all {{ criteria }}, do not modify the string of each!
- You should use `{{getlang topic}}` to write the rating manual, which is the language of the topic.
