# Task: Make Boolean Judgment

{{ prompt }}

## CFER Framework
When making your judgment, follow these principles:
- **Clear**: Assess the prompt against definitive criteria
- **Focused**: Evaluate only what's directly requested, avoiding scope creep
- **Evidence-based**: Base your judgment solely on the information provided
- **Responsive**: Provide precisely the boolean value that answers the prompt

## Judgment Guidelines
When determining your response:
1. Carefully analyze the exact wording of the prompt
2. Identify the specific criteria that determine a true/false answer
3. Apply logical reasoning without introducing external assumptions
4. Make a definitive decision based on the available information
{{#if affirm_case}}5. If {{affirm_case}}, respond `true`{{/if}}
{{#if deny_case}}6. If {{deny_case}}, respond `false`{{/if}}

## Response Format
Return your judgment as a single boolean value (true or false) in a JSON code block.

# Example:
----- Start of response example -----
```json
true
```
----- End of response example -----

## Format Requirements
- Response MUST be EXACTLY `true` or `false` within a JSON code block
- No explanations, qualifications, or additional text outside the code block
- No "maybe," "it depends," or other non-boolean responses
- No quotation marks around the boolean value in the JSON
