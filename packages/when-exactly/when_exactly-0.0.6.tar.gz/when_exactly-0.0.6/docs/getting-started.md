# Getting Started

## Installation

```bash
pip install when-exactly
```

## Usage

Since the name `when_exactly` is a bit verbose, it is recommended to use an import alias, such as `we`.

```python
>>> import when_exactly as we

```

Alternatively, you can import only what you need:

```python
>>> from when_exactly import Year, Month, Week # etc.

```
