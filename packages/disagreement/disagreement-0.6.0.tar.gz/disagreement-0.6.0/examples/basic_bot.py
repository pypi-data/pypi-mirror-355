# examples/basic_bot.py

"""
A basic example bot using the Disagreement library.

To run this bot:
1. Make sure you have the 'disagreement' library installed or accessible in your PYTHONPATH.
   If running from the project root, it should be discoverable.
2. Set the DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN environment variable to your bot's token.
   e.g., export DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_actual_token_here" (Linux/macOS)
         set DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_actual_token_here" (Windows CMD)
         $env:DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="your_actual_token_here" (Windows PowerShell)
3. Run this script: python examples/basic_bot.py
