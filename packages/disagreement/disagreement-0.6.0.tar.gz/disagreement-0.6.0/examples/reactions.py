# examples/reactions.py

"""
An example bot demonstrating reaction handling with the Disagreement library.

This bot will:
1. React to a specific command with a thumbs-up emoji.
2. Log when any reaction is added to a message in a server it's in.
3. Log when any reaction is removed from a message.

To run this bot:
1. Follow the setup steps in 'basic_bot.py' to set your DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN.
2. Ensure you have the GUILD_MESSAGE_REACTIONS intent enabled for your bot in the Discord Developer Portal.
3. Run this script: python examples/reactions.py
