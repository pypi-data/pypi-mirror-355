# HSI Wizard

See Beyond the Visible: The Magic of Hyperspectral Imaging for Medical & Bioinformatics Applications

<img src="./resources/imgs/hsi_wizard_logo.svg" alt="hsi_wizard_logo" style="width: 100%">



## Introduction

Welcome to the `hsi-wizard` package! Designed primarily for **medical hyperspectral imaging** and **bioinformatics workflows**, this Python package provides a straightforward environment for hyperspectral imaging (HSI) analysis, supporting everything from basic spectral analysis to advanced machine learning and AI methods. Whether you're working with raw sensor data or pre-processed datasets, `hsi-wizard` offers a suite of tools to simplify and enhance your analysis workflow.

If you're new here, the best place to start is the [documentation](https://hsi-wizard.readthedocs.io), where you'll find detailed instructions on how to begin.

## Features
- DataCube Class for managing and processing HSI data
- Spectral plotting and visualization
- Clustering and spectral analytics
- Tools for merging and processing HSI data
- Data loaders for various file formats (e.g., NRRD, Pickle, TDMS, and XLSX)
- Decorators for method tracking, input validation, and execution time logging

## Geospatial Limitations
This package does not track or process geographical coordinates. If you require full remote-sensing or GIS integration, you may need complementary tools. hsi-wizard focuses on medical and lab-based spectral analysis, so spatial georeferencing is restricted.

# Usage

After installing the package, you can import the DataCube, read function, and plotter for quick HSI data analysis:

```python3
import wizard

# Load an HSI datacube from a file
dc = wizard.read('path_to_file')

# process DataCube
dc.resize(x_new=500, y_new=500)
dc.remove_background()

# Visualize the datacube
wizard.plotter(dc)
```
