# Spherinator

[Spherinator](https://github.com/HITS-AIN/Spherinator) and
[HiPSter](https://github.com/HITS-AIN/HiPSter) are tools that provide explorative access
and visualization for multimodal data from extremely large astrophysical datasets, ranging from
exascale cosmological simulations to multi-billion object observational galaxy surveys.

A variational autoencoder (VAE) will be trained using
[PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/)
to compress the structural data into a low-dimensional spherical latent space.
