# This file should list alo-agent-sdk and any direct dependencies 
# of the specific agent/service project that are NOT covered by alo-agent-sdk.
# For a basic agent/registry, alo-agent-sdk itself might be the main requirement.

alo-agent-sdk==0.1.12

# Optional LLM dependencies can be installed by uncommenting if needed,
# or by installing the SDK with extras, e.g., pip install "alo-agent-sdk[openai]==0.1.12"
# # openai>=1.0.0,<2.0.0
# # anthropic>=0.20.0,<1.0.0
# # boto3>=1.20.0,<2.0.0
# # aioboto3>=10.0.0,<13.0.0
