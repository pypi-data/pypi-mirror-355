'''
FoldZ: A Python library specifically designed for simulating and rendering origami.
Origami Simulator: An online tool that also provides a Python API for interacting with simulations.
PyFold: A library to help with folding python code.
--------
1. FoldZ: 
This library provides tools for simulating and rendering folding of linkages and paper in both analytical and artistic contexts.
It supports symbolic and numerical processing modes, rendering to SVG images, and constrained optimization over origami foldings.
2. Oribir (Origami Bird Simulator):
This simulator is specifically designed for educational purposes, focusing on simulating the folding of origami birds.
It requires libraries like Qt4, PyQt4, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
3. KinegamiPython: 
This code allows users to create kinematic chains made of tubular origami patterns.
It supports revolute and prismatic joints connected by links, with the ability to modify and move joints.
4. Origami (PyPI):
This library focuses on binary serialization for Python objects, allowing you to fold and unfold data structures based on specified patterns.
5. Origami Simulator (Web-based):
While not a Python library, this web-based tool allows you to simulate how any origami crease pattern will fold.
It uses an iterative approach to solve for small displacements in the geometry.
6. FOLD File Format: 
FOLD is a file format for describing origami models, including crease patterns, mountain-valley patterns, and folded states.
While not a simulator itself, it serves as a common format for storing and exchanging origami data, which can be used in conjunction with simulation tools.
7. Sverchok (Blender Add-on):
This is a Blender add-on that enables rigid origami folding simulation.
It takes vertices, edges, and faces as input and simulates folding based on specified angles.
8. Rigid-Origami (gym-rori):
This library is designed for automating the design and simulation of rigid origami structures, with a focus on reinforcement learning applications.
9. Origami-lib:
This Python package provides tools for origami-related tasks.
10. Origamipy:
This package provides support for the LatticeDNAOrigami simulation program.
11. Origami (OCR):
This library offers a suite of tools for OCR tasks.
General Notes:
Many of these libraries rely on external dependencies such as NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, and Qt.
Some projects provide examples or tutorials to help users get started.
The choice of library depends on the specific goals of the simulation, such as educational purposes, kinematic analysis, or artistic exploration.
