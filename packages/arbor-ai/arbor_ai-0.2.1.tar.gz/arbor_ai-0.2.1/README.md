**A framework for optimizing DSPy programs with RL.**

[![PyPI Downloads](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/arbor-ai/month)](https://pepy.tech/projects/arbor-ai)

---

## üöÄ Installation

Install Arbor via pip:

```bash
pip install -U arbor-ai
```

Optionally, you can also install:
```bash
pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Make an `arbor.yaml` File

This is all dependent on your setup. Here is an example of one:
```yaml
inference:
  gpu_ids: '0'

training:
  gpu_ids: '1, 2'
```
Which will use the `GPU:0` for inference with `GPU:1` and `GPU:2` reserved for training. We generally recommend splitting the GPUs roughly evenly between inference and training.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Start the Server

**CLI:**

```bash
python -m arbor.cli serve --arbor-config arbor.yaml
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize a DSPy Program

Follow the DSPy tutorials here to see usage examples:
[DSPy RL Optimization Examples](https://dspy.ai/tutorials/rl_papillon/)

---

### Troubleshooting

**NCCL Errors**
Certain GPU setups, particularly with newer GPUs, seem to have issues with NCCL that cause Arbor to crash. Often times of these can be fixed with the following environment variables:

```bash
export NCCL_P2P_DISABLE=1
export NCCL_IB_DISABLE=1
```
