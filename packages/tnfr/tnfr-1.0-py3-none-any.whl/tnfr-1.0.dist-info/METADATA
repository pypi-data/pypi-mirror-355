# TNFR - Teoría de la naturaleza fractal resonante

**TNFR** is a Python package implementing the Teoría de la naturaleza fractal resonante (TNFR), a paradigm for modeling and simulating complex emergent systems based on structural coherence and resonant dynamics.

---

## What is TNFR?

TNFR provides a computational framework for studying how complex, self-organizing structures arise from simple interactions. Inspired by natural systems—such as biological networks, physical resonances, and social dynamics—TNFR models systems as networks of nodes with evolving structural properties.

---

## Key Features

- **Structural Coherence Modeling:**  
  - Each node in a TNFR network is characterized by parameters such as structural coherence (EPI), resonant frequency (νf), sense index (Si), and structural threshold (θ).
- **Emergent Dynamics Simulation:**  
  - The package allows you to simulate the evolution of networks over time, capturing how local interactions and transformations lead to global patterns and behaviors.
- **Symbolic Transformations (Glyphs):**  
  - TNFR includes a system of symbolic transformations (glyphs) that modify node properties, enabling the study of processes like emergence, mutation, resonance, and self-organization.
- **Adaptive Thresholds and Bifurcations:**  
  - The framework supports dynamic threshold calculations and the detection of structural bifurcations, allowing for the exploration of phase transitions and critical phenomena.
- **Flexible Analysis and Export:**  
  - TNFR provides tools for analyzing network evolution, detecting emergent patterns, and exporting results for further study.

## Who is TNFR for?

- **Researchers in complex systems, artificial intelligence, and network science**
- **Developers interested in novel paradigms for modeling and simulation**
- **Anyone curious about the principles of emergence, self-organization, and resonance in natural and artificial systems**
