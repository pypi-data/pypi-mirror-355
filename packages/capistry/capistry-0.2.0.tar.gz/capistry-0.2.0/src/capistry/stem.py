    Abstract base class for keycap stems.

    This class provides the foundation for creating the stem part of keycaps.
    It handles the common functionality of stem creation including geometry centering, spatial
    positioning, and joint creation for integration into keycap bodies.

    Parameters
    ----------
    center_at : CenterOf, default=CenterOf.GEOMETRY
        Centering mode for the stem geometry. Determines how the stem is positioned
        relative to its reference point within the keycap. Must be either `CenterOf.GEOMETRY`
        or `CenterOf.BOUNDING_BOX`.
    offset : Location, default=Location()
        Spatial offset for the stem. Allows translation and rotation of the stem
        from its default position within the keycap. Useful for angular adjustments in
        asymmetric keycap designs.

    Attributes
    ----------
    joint : RigidJoint
        The joint connection point for integrating the stem into a keycap body.

    Examples
    --------
    Create a basic MX stem:
    >>> mx_stem = MXStem()

    Create a stem with custom positioning:
    >>> offset_stem = MXStem(offset=Location((0, 0, 1)))

    Notes
    -----
    The Stem class inherits from both Comparable and Compound, enabling comparison
    operations and 3D geometry representation. All concrete implementations must
    provide a _builder method that defines the specific stem geometry.

    Stems are automatically split at the XY plane at the end of the  build phase
    to remove excess support material.

    leg_width : float, default=0.95
        Width (X-dimension) of each leg in millimeters. Determines the
        thickness of each leg.
    arc_length_ratio : float, default=0.45
        Ratio of leg length where the arched profile exists (0.0 to 1.0).
        Only used when include_arc is True. Higher values create arcs
        closer to the leg tips.
    arc_width_ratio : float, default=0.25

        arcs with an apex closer to the center of the legs.
    cross_length : float, default=3.7
        Length of the cross support arms (Y-dimension) in millimeters.
    cross_width : float, default=0.45
        Width of the cross support arms in millimeters.

        Fillet radius for the top edges of the legs in millimeters.
    fillet_legs_side : float, default=0.08
        Fillet radius for the side edges of the legs in millimeters.
    fillet_legs_bottom : float, default=0.1
        Fillet radius for the bottom edges of the legs in millimeters. Provides
        smooth transitions where legs meet the base.
    include_cross : bool, default=True
        Whether to include the cross support structure.
        Helps raise the keycap to avoid contacting the top housing on key presses.
    include_arc : bool, default=True
        Whether to use arched leg profiles instead of rectangular. Arched
        profiles can reduce stress by avoiding a vacuum forming when trying to remove keycaps.
    center_at : CenterOf, default=CenterOf.GEOMETRY
        Centering mode for the stem geometry.

        Spatial offset for the stem.
