## Deployment Steps

### PyPI Release

1. Update version number in `src/__version__.py`
2. Update package metadata in `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py`
3. Build the package:
   ```bash
   python -m build
   ```
4. Upload to PyPI:
   ```bash
   python -m twine upload dist/*
   ```
5. Verify installation from PyPI:
   ```bash
   pip install pcileech-fw-generator==0.3.1
   ```

### GitHub Release

1. Create a new tag for the release:
   ```bash
   git tag -a v0.3.1 -m "Version 0.3.1"
   git push origin v0.3.1
   ```
2. Create a new release on GitHub with release notes
3. Upload built packages as release assets
4. Update documentation on GitHub Pages if applicable

### Container Release

1. Build the container image with the new version:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/build_container.sh 0.3.1
   ```
2. Test the container image
3. Push the container image to the registry:
   ```bash
   podman push pcileech-fw-generator:0.3.1
   ```
4. Update container documentation with new version

## Post-Release Monitoring

### Metrics to Monitor

- PyPI download statistics
- GitHub issue tracker for bug reports
- Community forum activity
- Container image pulls
- Build success rate

### Support Plan

- Monitor GitHub issues for bug reports
- Provide timely responses to user questions
- Prepare hotfix releases if critical issues are discovered
- Document common issues and solutions in the troubleshooting guide

## Rollback Plan

In case of critical issues discovered after release:

1. Identify the issue and its severity
2. Determine if a hotfix is possible or if a rollback is necessary
3. If a hotfix is possible:
   - Develop and test the fix
   - Release a patch version (0.3.1)
4. If a rollback is necessary:
   - Communicate the rollback to users
   - Remove the problematic version from PyPI
   - Revert the GitHub release
   - Update documentation to reflect the rollback

## Feature Integration Details

### Full 4 KB Config-Space Shadow in BRAM

The configuration space shadow BRAM implementation provides a complete 4 KB PCI Express configuration space in block RAM (BRAM) on the FPGA. This feature is integrated with:

- **MSI-X Table Replication**: The config space shadow provides the configuration space data to the MSI-X capability parser.
- **Capability Pruning**: The config space shadow provides the configuration space data to the capability pruning module.
- **Deterministic Variance Seeding**: The config space shadow can extract the DSN from the configuration space for deterministic variance seeding.

### Auto-Replicate MSI-X Table

The MSI-X table replication feature extends the PCILeech FPGA firmware generator to accurately replicate the MSI-X capability structure from donor devices. This feature is integrated with:

- **Config Space Shadow**: The MSI-X capability parser extracts MSI-X table parameters from the configuration space.
- **Capability Pruning**: The capability pruning module preserves the MSI-X capability during pruning.
- **BAR Controller**: The BAR controller routes MSI-X table and PBA accesses to the appropriate memory regions.

### Capability Pruning

The PCI capability pruning feature extends the PCILeech FPGA firmware generator to analyze and selectively modify or remove PCI capabilities that cannot be faithfully emulated. This feature is integrated with:

- **Config Space Shadow**: The capability pruning module modifies the configuration space data before it is used to initialize the config space shadow.
- **MSI-X Table Replication**: The capability pruning module preserves the MSI-X capability during pruning.
- **Build Process**: The capability pruning module is integrated into the build process to apply pruning rules before generating the firmware.

### Deterministic Variance Seeding

The manufacturing variance simulation module provides realistic hardware variance simulation for PCIe device firmware generation. The deterministic variance seeding feature ensures that two builds of the same donor at the same commit fall in the same timing band. This feature is integrated with:

- **Config Space Shadow**: The deterministic variance seeding module can extract the DSN from the configuration space.
- **Build Process**: The deterministic variance seeding module is integrated into the build process to generate variance parameters based on the DSN and build revision.
- **SystemVerilog Generation**: The deterministic variance seeding module provides variance parameters to the SystemVerilog generation process.
