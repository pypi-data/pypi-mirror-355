# TUI Compatibility Indicators

This document explains the newly implemented compatibility indicators in the PCILeech Firmware Generator TUI interface.

## Overview

The TUI now provides enhanced visual indicators to help users quickly assess device compatibility and readiness for firmware generation. These indicators appear in the device table and detailed compatibility panel.

## Device Table Indicators

The device table includes the following columns:

- **Status**: Overall device status (✅/⚠️/❌)
- **BDF**: Bus:Device.Function address
- **Device**: Device name (vendor and model)
- **Indicators**: Compact multi-indicator status display
- **Driver**: Current driver binding
- **IOMMU**: IOMMU group assignment

### Indicators Column

The "Indicators" column displays a compact 5-character status showing:

1. **Device Validity** (✅/❌)
2. **Driver Status** (🔌/🔒/🔓)
3. **VFIO Compatibility** (🛡️/❌)
4. **IOMMU Status** (🔒/❌)
5. **Overall Readiness** (⚡/⚠️/❌)

Example: `✅🔓🛡️🔒⚡` indicates a fully ready device.

## Individual Indicator Meanings

### Device Validity Indicator
- **✅ Valid**: Device is properly detected and accessible
- **❌ Invalid**: Device is not properly accessible or detected

### Driver Status Indicator
- **🔌 No Driver**: No driver currently bound to device
- **🔒 Bound**: Device has a driver bound (may need detaching)
- **🔓 Detached**: Device is detached and ready for VFIO use

### VFIO Compatibility Indicator
- **🛡️ Compatible**: Device supports VFIO passthrough
- **❌ Incompatible**: Device cannot use VFIO passthrough

### IOMMU Status Indicator
- **🔒 Enabled**: IOMMU is properly configured for this device
- **❌ Disabled**: IOMMU is not properly configured

### Overall Readiness Indicator
- **⚡ Ready**: Device is ready for firmware generation
- **⚠️ Caution**: Device may work but has some compatibility issues
- **❌ Problem**: Device has significant compatibility issues

## Overall Status Logic

The overall readiness indicator follows this logic:

1. **Ready (⚡)**: Device is valid AND VFIO-compatible AND IOMMU-enabled
2. **Caution (⚠️)**: Device is suitable but missing some optimal conditions
3. **Problem (❌)**: Device is not suitable for firmware generation

## Compatibility Panel

When a device is selected, the compatibility panel shows:

### Device Information
- Device name and BDF address
- Final suitability score (0.0-1.0)
- Detailed status indicators

### Status Checks Table
The table shows detailed status information:

| Status Check | Result | Details |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| Device Accessibility | ✅ Valid / ❌ Invalid | Device detection status |
| Driver Status | 🔓 Detached / 🔒 Bound / 🔌 No Driver | Current driver binding |
| VFIO Support | 🛡️ Compatible / ❌ Incompatible | VFIO passthrough capability |
| IOMMU Configuration | 🔒 Enabled / ❌ Disabled | IOMMU group assignment |
| Overall Status | ⚡ Ready / ⚠️ Caution / ❌ Not Ready | Final assessment |

## Enhanced Suitability Scoring

The suitability scoring system now incorporates additional factors:

### Positive Factors (+score)
- **VFIO Compatible** (+0.2): Device supports VFIO passthrough
- **IOMMU Enabled** (+0.15): IOMMU is properly configured
- **Network Controller** (+0.1): Network devices are well-supported
- **Storage Controller** (+0.05): Storage devices have good compatibility
- **VFIO Ready** (+0.1): Device is detached and ready for VFIO use

### Negative Factors (-score)
- **Device Invalid** (-0.5): Device is not properly accessible
- **VFIO Incompatible** (-0.2): Device cannot use VFIO passthrough
- **IOMMU Disabled** (-0.15): IOMMU is not properly configured
- **Display Controller** (-0.1): Display controllers may have conflicts
- **Driver Bound** (-0.15): Device is bound to a non-VFIO driver
- **No BARs** (-0.2): No memory BARs detected
- **Limited BARs** (-0.05): Fewer than 2 BARs available

## Device Scenarios

### Ready Device (⚡)
A device that is:
- Properly detected and accessible
- Detached from host driver (bound to vfio-pci)
- VFIO-compatible
- IOMMU-enabled
- Has sufficient memory BARs

**Example**: Network card bound to vfio-pci with IOMMU group

### Caution Device (⚠️)
A device that is:
- Generally suitable but has some limitations
- May have a driver bound but is otherwise compatible
- Missing some optimal conditions

**Example**: Graphics card with driver bound but VFIO-compatible

### Problem Device (❌)
A device that has:
- Significant compatibility issues
- Invalid or inaccessible hardware
- VFIO incompatibility
- Missing IOMMU support

**Example**: Host bridge or system-critical device

## Performance Impact

The enhanced compatibility checking adds minimal overhead:
- Device scanning time increased by ~10-15%
- Additional sysfs reads for detailed status
- Cached results to avoid repeated checks
- Asynchronous processing to maintain UI responsiveness

## User Experience Improvements

### Quick Assessment
- Instant visual feedback on device compatibility
- Color-coded indicators for easy interpretation
- Compact display for overview scanning

### Detailed Analysis
- Comprehensive compatibility breakdown
- Clear explanations for each status check
- Actionable information for resolving issues

### Workflow Integration
- Seamless integration with existing build process
- Enhanced device selection guidance
- Improved error prevention and troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Device shows ❌ Invalid**
- Check if device is properly seated
- Verify device is detected by system (`lspci`)
- Check for hardware failures

**VFIO shows ❌ Incompatible**
- Verify VFIO modules are loaded
- Check device class compatibility
- Ensure device is not system-critical

**IOMMU shows ❌ Disabled**
- Enable IOMMU in BIOS/UEFI
- Add `intel_iommu=on` or `amd_iommu=on` to kernel parameters
- Reboot system after changes

**Driver shows 🔒 Bound**
- Unbind device from current driver
- Bind device to vfio-pci driver
- Use device manager tools for driver management

## Integration with Build Process

The compatibility indicators integrate with the build eligibility logic:

1. **Pre-build Validation**: Check device readiness before starting build
2. **Warning System**: Alert users to potential issues
3. **Automatic Filtering**: Hide incompatible devices from selection
4. **Build Optimization**: Use compatibility data for build configuration

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live updates of device status
- **Automatic Remediation**: Suggested fixes for common issues
- **Historical Tracking**: Device compatibility trends over time
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter devices by compatibility criteria
- **Export Functionality**: Save compatibility reports for analysis
