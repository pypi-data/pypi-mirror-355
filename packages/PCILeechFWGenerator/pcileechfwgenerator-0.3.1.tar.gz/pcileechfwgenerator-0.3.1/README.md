Generate spoofed PCIe DMA firmware from real donor hardware with a single command. The workflow rips the donor's configuration space, builds a personalized FPGA bit‑stream locally by default (or optionally in an isolated container), and (optionally) flashes your DMA card over USB‑JTAG.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install pcileechfwgenerator

# With TUI support (recommended)
pip install pcileechfwgenerator[tui]

# Development installation
pip install pcileechfwgenerator[dev]

# Get sudo wrapper
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ramseymcgrath/PCILeechFWGenerator/refs/heads/main/install-sudo-wrapper.sh

# Install sudo wrapper scripts (recommended for TUI and build commands)
./install-sudo-wrapper.sh
```

### Usage

```bash
# Interactive TUI interface (recommended)
pcileech-tui-sudo  # Use sudo wrapper (preserves Python path)
# OR
sudo pcileech-tui  # Direct sudo (may have module import issues)

# Main orchestrator - handles device enumeration, driver binding, container execution
pcileech-generate  # Interactive device selection and build
# OR with sudo wrapper for full automation
pcileech-build-sudo --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t  # Calls pcileech-generate with preserved Python path

# Direct orchestrator with sudo (recommended for automation)
sudo pcileech-generate --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t
```

### Device Suitability Indicators

In the TUI, devices are evaluated for firmware generation compatibility:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| ✅ | **Suitable**: Device is compatible and not bound to a driver |
| ⚠️ | **Suitable with Warning**: Device is compatible but bound to a driver |
| ❌ | **Not Suitable**: Device is not compatible for firmware generation |

A device is considered suitable when its suitability score is ≥ 0.7 and it has no compatibility issues.

## 📋 Requirements

### Software

This is primarily tested in Linux, with some fiddling you could probably get it to work on Windows too.

| Tool | Why you need it | Install |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Vivado Studio | Synthesis & bit‑stream generation | Download from Xilinx (any 2022.2+ release) |
| Podman | Rootless container runtime for the build sandbox | See installation instructions below |
| Python ≥ 3.9 | Host‑side orchestrator ([`generate.py`](generate.py)) | Distro package (python3) |
| λConcept usbloader | USB flashing utility for Screamer‑class boards | See installation instructions below |
| pciutils, usbutils | lspci / lsusb helpers | Available in most Linux distributions |

> **⚠️ Security Notice**
> Never build firmware on the same operating system you plan to run the attack from. Use a separate Linux box.

### Hardware

| Component | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Donor PCIe card | Any inexpensive NIC, sound, or capture card works. One donor → one firmware. Destroy or quarantine the donor after extraction. |
| DMA board | Supported Artix‑7 DMA boards (35T, 75T, 100T). Must expose the Screamer USB‑JTAG port. |

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### Method 1: pip Installation (Recommended)

```bash
# Install with TUI support
pip install pcileechfwgenerator[tui]

# Basic installation (CLI only)
pip install pcileechfwgenerator

# Development installation
git clone https://github.com/ramseymcgrath/PCILeechFWGenerator
cd PCILeechFWGenerator
pip install -e .[dev]
```

### Method 2: Manual Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ramseymcgrath/PCILeechFWGenerator
cd PCILeechFWGenerator

# Install system dependencies
sudo ./install.sh

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements-tui.txt  # For TUI support
# OR
pip install -r requirements.txt      # Basic installation
```

Re‑login or run `newgrp` afterwards so rootless Podman picks up subuid/subgid mappings.

## 🎮 Usage

### Interactive TUI Mode (Recommended)

The modern text-based interface provides guided workflows and real-time monitoring:

```bash
# Launch TUI (after pip installation)
sudo pcileech-tui

# Or from source
sudo python3 tui_generate.py
```

**TUI Features:**
- 🖥️ **Visual device browser** with enhanced PCIe device information
- ⚙️ **Guided configuration** with validation and profile management
- 📊 **Real-time build monitoring** with progress tracking and resource usage
- 🔍 **Intelligent error guidance** with suggested fixes
- 📡 **System status monitoring** for Podman, Vivado, USB devices, and more

See [`docs/TUI_README.md`](docs/TUI_README.md) for detailed TUI documentation.

### Command Line Mode

For automated workflows or scripting:

```bash
# Basic generation (interactive device selection)
sudo pcileech-generate

# Direct build with specific device (local build by default)
sudo pcileech-build --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t

# Build using donor_dump kernel module (opt-in)
sudo pcileech-build --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t --use-donor-dump

# Build using a previously saved donor information file
sudo pcileech-build --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t --donor-info-file /path/to/donor_info.json

# For manual donor dump generation, see the Manual Donor Dump Guide:
# docs/MANUAL_DONOR_DUMP.md

# Advanced generation with enhanced features
sudo pcileech-build --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t --advanced-sv

# Device-specific generation with behavior profiling
sudo pcileech-build --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t --advanced-sv \
  --device-type network --enable-behavior-profiling

# Selective feature control
sudo pcileech-build --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t --advanced-sv \
  --disable-power-management --disable-performance-counters
```

**Note:** When using container builds, the system will automatically build the required container image (`dma-fw`) if it doesn't exist. This happens during the first run and requires an internet connection to download base images.

**Output:** `output/firmware.bin` (FPGA bit‑stream ready for flashing).

### Legacy Mode (Source Installation)

```bash
# Traditional workflow (still supported)
sudo python3 generate.py
```

## 🔌 Flashing the DMA Board

> **Note:** These steps can run on the same machine or a different PC.

1. Power down, install the DMA card, and remove the donor.

2. Connect the USB‑JTAG port.

3. Flash:

```bash
usbloader -f output/firmware.bin      # auto‑detects Screamer VID:PID 1d50:6130
```

If multiple λConcept boards are attached, add `--vidpid <vid:pid>`.

**Usage:**
```bash
# Automatically enabled when DSN is available in donor device
sudo pcileech-build --bdf 0000:03:00.0 --board 75t --advanced-sv
```

For more details, see [INTEGRATED_FEATURES.md](docs/INTEGRATED_FEATURES.md).

### Manufacturing Variance Simulation

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Installation Problems:**
```bash
# If pip installation fails
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install pcileechfwgenerator[tui]

# For development installation issues
pip install -e .[dev]
```

**TUI Not Starting:**
```bash
# Check TUI dependencies
python -c "import textual; print('TUI dependencies OK')"

# Install TUI dependencies manually
pip install textual rich psutil watchdog
```

**Permission Issues:**
```bash
# Ensure proper permissions for PCIe operations
sudo usermod -a -G vfio $USER
sudo usermod -a -G dialout $USER  # For USB-JTAG access
```

**Container Issues:**
```bash
# Check Podman installation
podman --version

# Verify rootless setup
podman info | grep rootless

# Test container build and dependencies
./scripts/build_container.sh --test

# Manual container dependency check
podman run --rm pcileechfwgenerator:latest python3 -c "import psutil, pydantic; print('Dependencies OK')"

# Check container file structure
podman run --rm pcileechfwgenerator:latest ls -la /app/src/

# Test with specific capabilities (recommended)
podman run --rm --cap-add=SYS_RAWIO --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN pcileechfwgenerator:latest echo "Capability test passed"
```

**Donor Dump Issues:**
```bash
# If donor_dump module fails to build or load
# See the Manual Donor Dump Guide for step-by-step instructions:
# docs/MANUAL_DONOR_DUMP.md

# Manual donor dump extraction (Linux)
sudo insmod src/donor_dump/donor_dump.ko bdf=0000:03:00.0
cat /proc/donor_dump > donor_info.txt

# Windows donor dump extraction
# Run PowerShell as Administrator
.\scripts\windows_donor_dump.ps1 -BDF "0000:03:00.0" -OutputFile "donor_info.json"
```

**Container Security Best Practices:**
- Use specific capabilities (`--cap-add=SYS_RAWIO --cap-add=SYS_ADMIN`) instead of `--privileged` when possible
- Always mount output directories to preserve generated files: `-v ./output:/app/output`
- The container runs as non-root user `appuser` by default for security
- Use the build script for automated testing: `./scripts/build_container.sh --test`
