Installation
============

Installation of gpvisc can be done using pip:

.. code-block:: console
    
    python -m pip install gpvisc

We recommend using a dedicated Python environnement to install and run the code. 

Additional libraries not critical to gpvisc may be needed to run some of the Jupyter notebooks. The user should install those if encountering a "library not found" error, following the installation instructions of the missing library.
