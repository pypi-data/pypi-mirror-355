    Import all installed kineticstoolkit extensions.

    Any module that begins with ``kineticstoolkit_`` and is on PYTHONPATH
    will be imported into the ``kineticstoolkit.ext`` namespace.

    Parameters
    ----------
    None

    Returns
    -------
    A list of the imported extension names.

    Warning
    -------
    This function, introduced in version 0.8, is still experimental and
    may change its signature or behavior in the future.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is called automatically if Kinetics Toolkit is imported in
    lab mode::

        import kineticstoolkit.lab as ktk

    If your extension is not imported, try importing it manually before
    reporting a bug::

       import kineticstoolkit_EXTENSION_NAME

    If your extension doesn't import, you need to edit your PYTHONPATH or check
    that the extension is correctly installed.
