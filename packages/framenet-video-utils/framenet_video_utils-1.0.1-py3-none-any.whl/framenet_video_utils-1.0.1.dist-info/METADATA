from framenet_video_utils import get_video_details

# Get details from a local video file
video_details = get_video_details("path/to/my_video.mp4")

if video_details and "error" not in video_details:
    print(f"Duration: {video_details['duration_seconds']}s")
    print(f"Resolution: {video_details['resolution']['width']}x{video_details['resolution']['height']}")
    print(f"Frame Rate: {video_details['fps']} fps")
