.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The bob archive command can be used to manage binary artifact archives.
The command works on the archives defined in the user configuration \fI\%archive\fP .
The archives require the \fImanaged\fP flag.
The archives to work on need to be explicitly specified (\fI\-l\fP, \fI\-a\fP, \fI\-b\fP). These arguments are mutually exclusive.
Write access to the recipe root folder to create an index cache is required.
.sp
Artifacts are managed by the information included in their \fI\%Audit Trail\fP\&. See the Audit Trail documentation for a detailed description of
the included data. Currently the \fBbob archive\fP command has access to the
\fBmeta\fP, \fBbuild\fP and \fBmetaEnv\fP sections of the audit trail:
.INDENT 0.0

\fBbuild.date\fP: The date and time of the build (UTC, ISO 8601), e.g.

\fBATTENTION:\fP
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Be careful when matching by \fBmeta.package\fP\&. The retention expression (see
\fBclean\fP command below) has to match an actually present artifact. There
may be more than one possible path trough the dependency tree to the same
package.  It is also possible that multiple packages produce the identical
result. Only one such package will usually be built by Bob. None of these
alternate possible package paths are recorded so you should double check if
you query actually maches.

.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-l, \-\-local\fP
Instead of working with the archives defined in the user configuration, the command will operate in the working directory.
This can be useful for automated tasks running on a server. Make sure to have write access to the working directory.
.TP
.B \fB\-a, \-\-all\fP
Execute the command on all suitable archives defined in the user configuration.
.TP
.B \fB\-b, \-\-backend NAME\fP
\fINAME\fP is the name of the archive defined in the user configuration. Multiple archives may be provided by repeatedly using \fI\-b\fP\&.
The command is executed on all of those archives.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dry\-run\fP
Do not actually delete any artifacts but show what would get removed.
.TP
.B \fB\-n\fP
Don\(aqt rescan the archive for new artifacts. The command will work on the
last scanned data. Useful if the scan takes a long time (e.g. big archive
on network mount) and was already run recently.
.TP
.B \fB\-v\fP
Be a bit more chatty on what is done.
.TP
.B \fB\-f\fP
Return a non\-zero exit code in case of errors
.UNINDENT
.SH COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B clean
Remove unneeded artifacts from the archive.
.sp
The command takes one or more retention expressions. Any artifact that is
matched by at least one of the expressions or referenced transitively by a
matched artifact is kept. If an artifact is neither matched by any
expression nor referenced by a retained artifact it is deleted.
.sp
The expression language has the following general syntax:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
\fIPredicate\fP [\fBLIMIT\fP \fILimit\fP [\fBORDER BY\fP \fIField\fP [\fBASC\fP | \fBDESC\fP]]]
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The \fIPredicate\fP supports the following constructs:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
Strings are written with double quotes, e.g. \fB\(dqfoo\(dq\fP\&. To embed
double quotes in the string itself escape them with \fB\e\fP\&.
.IP \(bu 2
Certain fields from the audit trail can be accessed by their name.
Sub\-fields are specified with a dot operator, e.g. \fBmeta.package\fP\&. All
fields are case sensitive and of string type. Referencing a non\-existing
field is supported but will yield a distinct \(dqundefined\(dq value. This
special value can only be compared with \fB==\fP and \fB!=\fP with other
values.
.IP \(bu 2
Strings and fields can be compared by the following operators (in
decreasing precedence): \fB<\fP, \fB<=\fP, \fB>\fP, \fB>=\fP, \fB==\fP, \fB!=\fP\&.
They are compared character by character by their unicode code point. If
the end of a operand is reached before finding a difference the string
lengths are compared instead.
.IP \(bu 2
String comparisons can be logically combined with \fB&&\fP (and)
respectively \fB||\fP (or). There is also a \fB!\fP (not) logical operator.
.IP \(bu 2
Parenthesis can be used to override precedence.
.UNINDENT
.sp
The optional \fILimit\fP field must be an integer number greater than zero. It
limits the number of artifacts that are retained by \fIPredicate\fP\&. If no
\fILimit\fP is specified all matching artifacts are retained. By default the
artifacts are sorted by the \fBbuild.date\fP field in descending order so
that only the most recent \fILimit\fP artifacts are retained.  If \fIField\fP is
not populated the artifact is always put at the end of the list. Specify
\fBASC\fP to sort the artifacts in ascending order by \fIField\fP\&.
.sp
A typical usage of the \fBclean\fP command is to remove old artifacts from a
continuous build artifact archive. Suppose the root package that is built
is called \fBplatform/app\fP and we want to retain only artifacts that are
referenced by builds that are at most seven days old:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bob archive clean \(dqmeta.package == \e\(dqplatform/app\e\(dq && \e
                   build.date >= \e\(dq$(date \-u \-Idate \-d\-7days)\e\(dq\(dq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
The following example retains only the last three builds from a recipe:
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bob archive clean \(aqmeta.recipe == \(dqroot\(dq LIMIT 3\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.sp
Both examples above can be combined, e.g. to keep all builds of the last
week while making sure that at least the last build is kept, even if that
build is older.
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
.sp
.nf
.ft C
bob archive clean \(dqmeta.package == \e\(dqplatform/app\e\(dq && \e
                   build.date >= \e\(dq$(date \-u \-Idate \-d\-7days)\e\(dq\(dq \e
                  \(aqmeta.package == \e\(dqplatform/app\e\(dq LIMIT 1\(aq
.ft P
.fi
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B find
Find artifacts matching a retention expression.
.sp
This expressions that can be given to this command are the same as for the
\fBclean\fP command above. All artifacts that match at least one of the
expressions are printed on stdout. Use this command to search for
particular artifacts or to check that you retention expressions actually
match the intended artifacts.
.TP
.B scan
Scan for added artifacts.
.sp
The \fBarchive\fP command keeps a cache of all indexed artifacts. To freshen
this cache use this command. Even though other sub\-commands will do a scan
too (unless suppressed by \fB\-n\fP) it might be helpful to do the scan on a
more convenient time. If the archive is located e.g. on a slow network
drive it could be advantageous to scan the archive with a cron job over
night.
.UNINDENT
.SH NOTES
.sp
\fBbob archive\fP only works for local binary artifact archives. If you\(aqre using a
remote archive, you need shell access and a working Bob installation on the
machine providing your archive in order to be able to use \fBbob archive\fP\&.
