.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
The \fBbob jenkins\fP command can be used to build a project on a Jenkins server
remotely. Bob will create the necessary Jenkins jobs on the server, configure
them and queue their build. If recipes or configuration options are updated,
the Jenkins jobs will be updated incrementally as needed.
.sp
For the most common usage two steps are necessary: add a Jenkins configuration
under an alias name and push this configuration to the server. A Jenkins
configuration is created by \fBbob jenkins add\fP which can later be updated by
\fBbob jenkins set\-options\fP or \fBset\-url\fP\&. To push the current configuration
to the server use \fBbob jenkins push\fP\&. As a rule of thumb Bob will create one
job for each built recipe.
.sp
For more details and an overview about the required Jenkins configuration,
please read the \fI\%Jenkins Tutorial\fP\&.
.SH OPTIONS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \fB\-\-add\-root ADD_ROOT\fP
Add new root package. See the \fB\-\-root\fP option below for its detailed
description.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-authtoken AUTHTOKEN\fP
Add an authentication token to restrict remote build triggers.
.sp
A job build can be scheduled by sending a HTTP POST request to
\fB$JENKINS_URL/job/$JOB/build\fP\&. To allow unauthenticated scripts to be
able to trigger builds too, a secret authentication token can be added to
all jobs and the build can be started by POSTing to
\fB$JENKINS_URL/job/$JOB/build?token=AUTHTOKEN\fP\&. Note that you have to keep
the token secret because anyone who has the right to view the job
configuration will be able to trigger a build.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-clean\fP
Do clean builds. This is the default.
.sp
Whenever a Jenkins job is triggered, the workspace is erased first. This
will cause a fresh checkout of the sources and a clean (re)build of all
packages in the job.
.sp
Use this option to ensure reproducibility at the expense of speed.
Enabled by default. See \fB\-\-incremental\fP for the opposite switch.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-credentials CREDENTIALS\fP
Credentials ID for git/svn SCM checkouts.
.sp
By default SCM checkouts of Git and Subversion modules are done
anonymously. This might be insufficient if the Jenkins build nodes lack
the proper credentials to access the repositories. Jenkins has a built\-in
credentials store (\(dqManage Jenkins Â» Credentials\(dq) where passwords and
SSH keys can be managed. Add the required credentials there and use the
\(dqID\(dq field of the required entry here as \fBCREDENTIALS\fP parameter. Usually
the ID will be a UUID but Jenkins allows any unique identifier to be used.
.sp
All jobs of an alias will be configured with the same credentials. If a
more fine grained credentials configurations is required, a plugin must be
used. See the \fI\%\(dqJenkins job mangling\(dq\fP
section in the manual for more information.
.TP
.B \fB\-D DEFINES\fP
Override default environment variable.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-del\-root DEL_ROOT\fP
Remove existing root package.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-dev\-sandbox\fP
Enable development sandboxing.
.sp
Always build packages in an isolated environment where only declared
dependencies are visible. If a sandbox image is available, it is used.
Otherwise the host paths are made read\-only.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-download\fP
Enable downloads from binary archive. Disabled by default. There must
be at least one binary archive in the user configuration
\fI\%archive\fP section that is enabled
for Jenkins builds.
.TP
.B \fB\-f, \-\-force\fP
Force the operation, potentially with loss of information. The exact
semantics depend on the sub\-command where the switch is used:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B \fBpush\fP
Overwrite existing jobs.
.sp
By default, Bob will refuse to overwrite jobs that were not created by
himself. If you are sure that the existing jobs are safe to be
overwritten, you can use this switch. Otherwise the jobs must be either
deleted manually or by the \fBprune\fP command of the project that
created the them in the first place. Additionally all job
configurations are written, even if they have not changed. This
overwrites any possible manual changes made to the jobs.
.TP
.B \fBrm\fP
Remove the Jenkins alias, even if there are active jobs. You will have
to delete the jobs manually.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-host\-platform\fP
Jenkins host platform type. May be any of \fBlinux\fP, \fBmsys\fP or \fBwin32\fP\&.
.sp
This specifies the host operating system where the Jenkins master and the
build slaves are running. By default this is the type of the current
operating system.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-incremental\fP
Reuse workspace for incremental builds.
.sp
Bob will still apply the internal heuristics to make clean builds where
recipes or any of the dependencies were changed. Use \fB\-\-clean\fP to always
force clean builds of packages.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-intermediate\fP
Delete everything except root jobs.
.sp
Use this switch if you want to delete a project from the Jenkins server
but want to keep the jobs with the final artifacts. The root jobs will
be disabled because their dependencies are deleted. You can push an alias
again to re\-create all jobs and re\-enable the root jobs.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-keep\fP
Keep obsolete jobs by disabling them instead of deleting.
.sp
If the recipes or configuration of a project is changed, some of the
previously required packages could become unnecessary. By default Bob will
delete the corresponding jobs. By using the \fB\-\-keep\fP switch these jobs
will merely be disabled. This retains the build logs and artifacts.
.sp
You can use \fBbob jenkins prune \-\-obsolete\fP to delete disabled jobs
manually. See \fB\-\-no\-keep\fP for the inverse option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-longdescription\fP
Display all paths of all packages in the job description.
.sp
Note that the number of displayed package paths of (content wise) identical
packages is still limited. Nonetheless it is computationally expensive to
calculate every possible package path in the first place. Except for
trivial projects this might cause a noticeable delays in the Jenkins
configuration. See \fB\-\-shortdescription\fP on how to disable this behaviour.
.TP
.B \fB\-n NODES, \-\-nodes NODES\fP
Label expression for Jenkins slave. If empty, the jobs can be scheduled on
any slave.
.sp
In the Jenkins configuration every build node can be assigned one or more
label. The expression given in \fBNODES\fP restricts on which build nodes
the jobs can be scheduled. It can either be a single label or a boolean
expression of labels. The \(dqbuilt\-in\(dq label is pre\-defined and identifies
the Jenkins master. Expressions can use parentheses \(dq(expression)\(dq, negation \(dq!\(dq,
logical AND \(dq&&\(dq and logical OR \(dq||\(dq.
.sp
Examples:
.INDENT 7.0
.IP \(bu 2
\fBwin32\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fBlinux && 64bit\fP
.IP \(bu 2
\fB!win32 || (vm && mysql)\fP
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-download\fP
Disable binary archive downloads. This is the default. See \fB\-\-download\fP
for the enabling counterpart.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-keep\fP
Delete obsolete jobs. This is the default.
.sp
Jobs that are not required any more will be deleted. Use \fB\-\-keep\fP if
you instead want to just disable such jobs.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-sandbox\fP
Disable sandboxing during builds.
.sp
Unless required by the project, it is discouraged to disable the sandbox
feature. See \fB\-\-sandbox\fP, \fB\-\-slim\-sandbox\fP, \fB\-\-dev\-sandbox\fP or
\fB\-\-strict\-sandbox\fP for the opposite switches.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-ssl\-verify\fP
Disable HTTPS certificate checking.
.sp
By default only secure connections are allowed to HTTPS Jenkins servers. If
this option is given then any certificate error is ignored. This was the
default before Bob 0.15.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-trigger\fP
Do not trigger build for updated jobs.
.sp
You have to manually schedule the build of all changed jobs. Triggering
only a subset of the affected jobs can lead to build errors because of
unbuilt dependencies. Use with caution.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-no\-upload\fP
Disable binary archive uploads. This is the default. See \fB\-\-upload\fP
for the enabling counterpart.
.TP
.B \fB\-o OPTIONS\fP
Set extended Jenkins options. This option expects a \fBkey=value\fP pair to
set one particular extended configuration parameter. May be specified
multiple times. See \fI\%Extended Options\fP for the list of
available options. Setting an empty value deletes the option.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-obsolete\fP
Delete obsolete jobs that are currently not needed according to the
recipes. Use this switch with the \fBprune\fP command to delete jobs that
are left disabled due to \fB\-\-keep\fP being active.
.TP
.B \fB\-p PREFIX, \-\-prefix PREFIX\fP
Prefix for job names.
.sp
By default the job names are derived from the recipe and package names. If
you want to build the same project with different configurations on the
same server you will have to use unique prefixes for each. Otherwise the
jobs names will collide and configuration will fail.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-password\fP
Set password for Jenkins authentication.
.sp
You can also set the user name and password persistently by encoding it
into the Jenkins url directly, e.g. \fIhttps:://user:password@host/\fP\&.
.sp
\fBATTENTION:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
On Linux users can usually see the program arguments of processes from
other users. By using the \fB\-\-password\fP you could inadvertently reveal
the password to untrusted other users that have access to the same
machine.  It is safer to either enter the password manually or to pipe
it through stdin.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B \fB\-q, \-\-quiet\fP
Decrease verbosity (may be specified multiple times).
.TP
.B \fB\-r ROOT, \-\-root ROOT\fP
Root package to build (may be specified multiple times).
.sp
Specify the root packages that are built. All dependencies are added
implicitly. Jobs building the root packages are treated a bit differently
in that their logs and artifacts will be retained indefinitely by default.
See the \fBjobs.gc.*\fP extended options on how to tweak this behavior.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-reset\fP
Reset all options to their default.
.sp
Use this option to revert all configuration options back to their default
state. This option is applied before all other options of the
\fBset\-options\fP sub\-command. Use it to configure an alias without relying
on the previous state.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-sandbox\fP
Enable partial sandboxing. This is the default.
.sp
Build packages in an ephemeral container if a sandbox image is available
for the package. Inside the sandbox, stable execution paths are used. In
absence of a sandbox image, no isolation is performed.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-shortdescription\fP
Do not calculate every possible path of each package in a job for the
description. This leads to shorter job descriptions and, depending on the
project complexity, might reduce the configuration time considerably. The
drawback is that not all packages are then listed in the job description.
For each unique package only one example path will be shown.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-slim\-sandbox\fP
Enable slim sandboxing.
.sp
Build packages in an isolated mount namespace. Most of the host paths
are available read\-only. Other workspaces are hidden when building a
package unless they are a declared dependency. An optionally available
sandbox image is \fInot\fP used.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-strict\-sandbox\fP
Enable strict sandboxing.
.sp
Always build packages in an isolated environment where only declared
dependencies are visible. If a sandbox image is available, it is used.
Otherwise the host paths are made read\-only. The build path is always
a reproducible, stable path.
.TP
.B \fB\-U UNDEFINES\fP
Undefine environment variable override. This removes a variable previously
defined with \fB\-D\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-upload\fP
Upload to binary archives. Disabled by default. There must
be at least one binary archive in the user configuration
\fI\%archive\fP section that is enabled
for Jenkins builds.
.sp
If the upload fails the respective job will fail too, unless the \fBnofail\fP
option was set on the archive entry in the configuration.
.TP
.B \fB\-\-user\fP
Set user name for Jenkins authentication.
.sp
You can also set the user name persistently by encoding it into the Jenkins
url directly, e.g. \fIhttps:://user@host/\fP\&.
.TP
.B \fB\-v, \-\-verbose\fP
Show additional information. Can be given multiple times to further
increase the output verbosity.
.TP
.B \fB\-w, \-\-windows\fP
Jenkins is running on Windows with an MSYS2 environment. This option has
been deprecated in favour of \fB\-\-host\-platform msys\fP switch.
.UNINDENT
.SH COMMANDS
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B add
Add an alias for a Jenkins configuration.
.sp
The alias will hold the URL of the Jenkins, the desired configuration (e.g.
what packages should be built) and the state of the last uploaded
configuration. The state will be stored in the current project workspace.
Any number of aliases can be added.
.sp
Adding an alias is the first step required to build a project on a Jenkins
server. The configuration for this alias can be later updated by the
\fBset\-options\fP and \fBset\-url\fP commands. To remove an alias use the \fBrm\fP
command.
.TP
.B export
Write the Jenkins configuration of an alias to a directory.
.sp
For each job, the generated config.xml file will be created in the output
directory. This is mainly a debugging aid and can be used to inspect the
generated configuration. It is \fInot\fP intended to upload these configuration
files to a Jenkins server. Use \fBpush\fP for that.
.TP
.B graph
Generate a Graphviz dot graph.
.sp
Feed the generated graph through the \fBdot\fP tool to get a visualization
about the jobs and their dependencies.
.TP
.B ls
List all configured Jenkins aliases and their configuration.
.sp
Without any further options, only the list of Jenkins aliases is shown. By
adding the \fB\-v\fP option the configuration of each alias is displayed too.
A 2nd \fB\-v\fP will additionally show all currently configured jobs.
.TP
.B prune
Prune jobs from Jenkins server.
.sp
By default all jobs managed by the Jenkins alias will be deleted. If the
\fB\-\-keep\fP option is enabled for this alias, you may use the \fB\-\-obsolete\fP
option to delete only currently disabled (obsolete) jobs. Alternatively you
may delete all intermediate jobs and keep only the root jobs by using
\fB\-\-intermediate\fP\&. This will disable the root jobs because they cannot run
anyway without failing.
.TP
.B push
Push current configuration of an alias to the Jenkins server.
.sp
This will create or update all necessary jobs and schedule their build. By
default obsolete jobs will be deleted unless the \fB\-\-keep\fP option has been
enabled. If you just want to create or update the jobs without scheduling
their build, use the \fB\-\-no\-trigger\fP option. Bob won\(aqt overwrite jobs that
were not created by Bob for the Jenkins alias itself unless the \fB\-f\fP
option is given.
.sp
Existing jobs will be updated as necessary. In the default configuration
this happens always because the job description displays the state of the
recipes and the time of the \fBbob jenkins push\fP operation. Use one of the
other modes of the \fBjobs.update\fP extended option to speed up the push
operation at the expense of slightly outdated job descriptions.
.TP
.B rm
Remove Jenkins alias.
.sp
The alias will not be removed if jobs are still existing. It is thus
usually required to run the \fBprune\fP command before to delete all jobs of
an alias. Alternatively the \fB\-f\fP switch may be used to remove the alias
even though the state indicates that there are still existing jobs. This is
useful e.g. if the Jenkins server is not running any more or the jobs have
already been deleted externally.
.TP
.B set\-options
Change configuration of an alias.
.sp
Can update all options of an alias except the server URL. The new
configuration can then be synchronized to the Jenkins server by a
subsequent \fBpush\fP command. To revert the whole configuration to its
default state use \fB\-\-reset\fP\&. This is done as the first step so that you
can combine \fB\-\-reset\fP with all other options to fully control all
options.
.TP
.B set\-url
Update server URL of an alias.
.UNINDENT
.SH EXTENDED OPTIONS
.sp
The following extended Jenkins options are available. Any unrecognized options
will be rejected.
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B artifacts.copy
This options selects the way of sharing archives between workspaces.
Possible values are:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B jenkins
Store the result and \fI\%Build\-Id\fP of the job on the Jenkins master.
Subsequently the downstream job will be configured to use the copy
artifact plugin to copy the artifact into it\(aqs workspace. This is the
default.
.TP
.B archive
Only store the \fI\%Build\-Id\fP on the Jenkins master and use a
separate binary archive for sharing artifacts. Must be used together
with \fB\-\-upload\fP and \fB\-\-download\fP\&.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B audit.meta.<var>
Assign the meta variable \fB<var>\fP to the given value in the audit trail.
The variable can later be matched by \fI\%bob archive\fP as
\fBmeta.<var>\fP to select artifacts built by this project. Variables that are
defined by Bob itself (e.g. \fBmeta.jenkins\-node\fP) cannot be redefined!
.TP
.B jobs.gc.deps.artifacts
The number of build artifacts that are retained of intermediate or leaf
jobs. Only useful for \fBartifacts.copy=jenkins\fP\&. Protocols and build logs
are not affected and will still be kept. Defaults to \fB1\fP\&. If set to 0 all
artifacts will be retained.
.TP
.B jobs.gc.deps.builds
Configure the number of builds that are retained of intermediate and leaf
jobs. Logs and artifacts of old builds exceeding this threshold are deleted
automatically by Jenkins. A separate binary archive
(\fBartifacts.copy=archive\fP) is not affected and must be separately managed
with \fI\%bob archive\fP\&. If not set, all Jenkins builds
will be kept.
.TP
.B jobs.gc.root.artifacts
The number of build artifacts that are retained of root\-jobs. Only useful
for \fBartifacts.copy=jenkins\fP\&. Protocols and build logs are not affected
and will still be kept. By default everything will be retained.
.TP
.B jobs.gc.root.builds
Configure the number of builds that are retained of root\-jobs. These are
jobs that build packages that were given by the \fB\-r\fP option. Logs and
artifacts of old builds exceeding this threshold are deleted automatically
by Jenkins. A separate binary archive (\fBartifacts.copy=archive\fP) is not
affected but must be separately managed with \fI\%bob archive\fP\&.  If not set, all Jenkins builds will be kept.
.TP
.B jobs.isolate
Regular expression that is matching package names. Any package that is
matched is put into a separate job. Multiple variants of the same package
are still kept in the same job, though.
.sp
This option might be used to single out specific packages into dedicated
Jenkins jobs that are unrelated to other jobs in the recipe. Typical use
cases are documentation and testing \fBmultiPackage\fP that should not
prevent other packages from building if they fail. The obvious draw back is
that common checkout and build steps might be duplicated to multiple jobs,
though.
.TP
.B jobs.policy
Controls how downstream jobs are triggered and which artifacts of the
upstream jobs are used. By default only stable jobs trigger further
downstream builds. The following settings are available:
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B stable
Downstream jobs are triggered only if the build was stable. Likewise,
only the artifacts of stable upstream builds are used. This is the
default.
.TP
.B unstable
Downstream jobs are triggered on successful builds, that is stable and
unstable builds. The downstream jobs will also use the last build that
succeeded, even if that build was unstable.
.TP
.B always
Downstream jobs are triggered regardless of the build result, even on
failed builds. The artifacts are taken from the last completed build of
the upstream job which might not necessarily have published one because
it failed before archiving them.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B jobs.update
Whenever the recipes are changed Bob has to update the individual Jenkins
jobs that are affected by the change. This switch controls how the
description and audit trail information is updated if only these are
affected by the change. Their update may be deferred unless strictly
necessary and still generate a correct build result at the expense of the
freshness of this information.
.INDENT 7.0
.TP
.B always
Always update the description and audit trail information if they
change. This is the default. Note that \fBbob jenkins push\fP will always
update the description because the date and time of the update is part
of the job description.
.TP
.B description
Keep the description up\-to\-date but defer audit trail updates unless
strictly necessary. This may provide marginal speed gains but will
still update all jobs because the description contains the recipe
version and update time.
.TP
.B lazy
Only update a job if it will build a different artifact than before.
The description and audit trail information will be left unchanged
otherwise. This will provide considerable speed improvements at the
expense of an outdated description of the unchanged jobs.
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B scm.always\-checkout
Boolean option (possible values: \(aq0\(aq or \(aqfalse\(aq resp. \(aq1\(aq or \(aqtrue\(aq) that
forces the execution of checkout steps. This option is enabled by default.
If disabled, the checkout might be skipped if a matching binary artifact
can be found.
.sp
Disabling this option can increase the build speed. On the other hand, it
might hide problems in recipes where the checkout step is not
deterministic. Note that git and svn SCMs are checked out regardless of
this option. For release builds it is best to keep the option enabled.
.TP
.B scm.git.shallow
Instruct the Jenkins git plugin to create shallow clones with a history
truncated to the specified number of commits. If the parameter is unset
or \(dq0\(dq the full history will be cloned.
.sp
\fBWARNING:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
Setting this parameter too small may prevent the creation of a proper
change log. Jenkins will not be able to find the reference commit of
the last run if the branch advanced by more commits than were cloned.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.TP
.B scm.git.timeout
Instruct the Jenkins git plugin to use the given timeout (minutes) for clone
and fetch operations.
.TP
.B scm.ignore\-hooks
Boolean option (possible values: \(aq0\(aq or \(aqfalse\(aq resp. \(aq1\(aq or \(aqtrue\(aq) to set
the \(dqIgnore post\-commit hooks\(dq option on all jobs. This instructs Jenkins
to ignore changes notified by SCM post\-commit hooks if enabled. You should
probably set a sensible polling interval with the \fBscm.poll\fP option
unless you want to trigger the generated jobs manually.
.TP
.B scm.poll
Without this option the Jenkins server is dependent on external commit
hooks to be notified of changes in the source code repositories. While this
is the preferred solution it might be necessary to fall back to polling in
some setups. Set this option to a \fI\%Jenkins flavoured cron line\fP, e.g.
\fBH/15 * * * *\fP\&.
.TP
.B shared.dir
Any packages that are marked as \fI\%shared\fP
(\fBshared: True\fP) are installed upon usage on a Jenkins slave in a shared
location. By default this is \fB${JENKINS_HOME}/bob\fP\&. To use another
directory set this option to an absolute path.
.sp
\fBATTENTION:\fP
.INDENT 7.0
.INDENT 3.5
The string is subject to \fI\%string substitution\fP\&.  It is possbile to substitute

Make sure that any meta characters are properly escaped. Because
backslash is such a character, special care must be taken on Windows. It
is best to always use forward slashes, even on Windows, to evade any
escaping issues.

.B shared.quota
Set a limit to the amount of disk space that is used for the shared
location on each build node. By default there is no limit. The size is
given in bytes with optional magnitude suffix. The standard IEC units are
supported (\fBKiB\fP, \fBMiB\fP, \fBGiB\fP and \fBTiB\fP) which can optionally be
abbreviated by leaving out the \fBiB\fP suffix (e.g. \fBG\fP for \fBGiB\fP). SI
units (base 1000) are supported too (\fBKB\fP,  \fBMB\fP, \fBGB\fP, and \fBTB\fP).

Only unused packages will be deleted when the quota is reached. If there
are no unused shared packages, e.g. because the workspaces of obsolte
jobs were not deleted, it is still possible that the disk usage is above
the quota.
