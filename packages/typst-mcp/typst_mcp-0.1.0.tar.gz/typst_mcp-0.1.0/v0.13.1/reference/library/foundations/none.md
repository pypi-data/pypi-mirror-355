# None

A value that indicates the absence of any other value.

The none type has exactly one value: `{none}`.

When inserted into the document, it is not visible. This is also the value
that is produced by empty code blocks. It can be
[joined]($scripting/#blocks) with any value, yielding the other value.

# Example
```example
Not visible: #none
```
