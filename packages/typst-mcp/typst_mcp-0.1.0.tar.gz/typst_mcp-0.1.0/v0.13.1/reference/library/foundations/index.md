# Foundations

Foundational types and functions.

Here, you'll find documentation for basic data types like [integers]($int) and
[strings]($str) as well as details about core computational functions.


## Definitions

- [`arguments`](/reference/library/foundations/arguments/) - Captured arguments to a function.
- [`array`](/reference/library/foundations/array/) - A sequence of values.
- [`assert`](/reference/library/foundations/assert/) - Ensures that a condition is fulfilled.
- [`auto`](/reference/library/foundations/auto/) - A value that indicates a smart default.
