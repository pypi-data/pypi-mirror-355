# Spacing (H)

## `h`

Inserts horizontal spacing into a paragraph.

The spacing can be absolute, relative, or fractional. In the last case, the
remaining space on the line is distributed among all fractional spacings
according to their relative fractions.

# Example
```example
First #h(1cm) Second \
First #h(30%) Second
```

# Fractional spacing
With fractional spacing, you can align things within a line without forcing
a paragraph break (like [`align`] would). Each fractionally sized element
gets space based on the ratio of its fraction to the sum of all fractions.

```example
First #h(1fr) Second \
First #h(1fr) Second #h(1fr) Third \
First #h(2fr) Second #h(1fr) Third
```

# Mathematical Spacing { #math-spacing }
In [mathematical formulas]($category/math), you can additionally use these
constants to add spacing between elements: `thin` (1/6 em), `med` (2/9 em),
`thick` (5/18 em), `quad` (1 em), `wide` (2 em).

## Parameters

### amount *(required)*

How much spacing to insert.

### weak 

If `{true}`, the spacing collapses at the start or end of a paragraph.
Moreover, from multiple adjacent weak spacings all but the largest one
collapse.

Weak spacing in markup also causes all adjacent markup spaces to be
removed, regardless of the amount of spacing inserted. To force a space
next to weak spacing, you can explicitly write `[#" "]` (for a normal
space) or `[~]` (for a non-breaking space). The latter can be useful to
create a construct that always attaches to the preceding word with one
non-breaking space, independently of whether a markup space existed in
front or not.
