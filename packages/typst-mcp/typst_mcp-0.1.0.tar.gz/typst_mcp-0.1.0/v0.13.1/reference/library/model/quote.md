# Quote

## `quote`

Displays a quote alongside an optional attribution.

# Example
```example
Plato is often misquoted as the author of #quote[I know that I know
nothing], however, this is a derivation form his original quote:

#set quote(block: true)

#quote(attribution: [Plato])[
  ... ἔοικα γοῦν τούτου γε σμικρῷ τινι αὐτῷ τούτῳ σοφώτερος εἶναι, ὅτι
  ἃ μὴ οἶδα οὐδὲ οἴομαι εἰδέναι.
]
#quote(attribution: [from the Henry Cary literal translation of 1897])[
  ... I seem, then, in just this little thing to be wiser than this man at
  any rate, that what I do not know I do not think I know either.
]
```

By default block quotes are padded left and right by `{1em}`, alignment and
padding can be controlled with show rules:
```example
#set quote(block: true)
#show quote: set align(center)
#show quote: set pad(x: 5em)

#quote[
  You cannot pass... I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the
  flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you,
  flame of Udûn. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass.
]
```
