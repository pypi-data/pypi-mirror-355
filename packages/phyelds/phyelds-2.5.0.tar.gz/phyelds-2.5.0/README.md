# Phyelds

Phyelds (pronounced *fields*) is a Python-native aggregate computing library designed to help you build decentralized, large-scale systems using elegant and composable abstractions (computational *fields*).

## ✨ Features

* **🐍 Pythonic by Design**: Clean syntax, functional patterns, and intuitive APIs for fast prototyping.
* **🧩 Field-Based Programming**: Define spatial-temporal behavior via *fields* that evolve across devices.
* **🌐 Collective Intelligence**: Each node runs the same logic, yet adapts locally using neighborhood information.
* **🔬 Ideal for Simulation**: Run, visualize, and test aggregate programs in controlled virtual environments.
* **📦 Lightweight & Flexible**: Minimal dependencies, plug-and-play components.
