## Example AI Conversation

With this MCP server running, you can have conversations like:

> **You:** "What meeting types do I have available?"
>
> **AI:** _Uses `list_event_types()` to show your Cal.com event types_
>
> **You:** "Book a 30-minute consultation with John Doe (john@example.com) for tomorrow at 2 PM"
>
> **AI:** _Uses `create_booking()` to schedule the meeting and confirms the booking_

## Security Note
