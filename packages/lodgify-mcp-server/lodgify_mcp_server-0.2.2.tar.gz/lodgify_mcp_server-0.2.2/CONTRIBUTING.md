# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to the Lodgify MCP Server! To get started:

1. **Install development dependencies**

   Use `uv` to install all development requirements into your environment:

   ```bash
   uv pip install --system -e '.[dev]'
   ```

   This installs the server in editable mode along with testing tools.

2. **Run the test suite**

   Make sure the tests pass before opening a pull request:

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

3. **Code style**

   Follow the existing code style and keep changes focused.

Feel free to open an issue or pull request with any questions!
