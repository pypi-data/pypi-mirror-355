# Nectar2P

**Nectar2P** — A secure and fast open-source Python library for P2P file transfers, featuring optional encryption and NAT traversal support. With nectar2p, you can easily transfer files between devices on the same network or across different networks.

## Features

- **Secure File Transfer**: Provides RSA and AES-GCM encryption for confidentiality and integrity.
- **Optional Encryption**: Enable or disable encryption for file transfer as per requirement.
- **NAT Traversal**: Supports connections between devices behind NATs.
- **Peer Authentication**: Allows verification of the remote party's RSA public key.
- **Modular Design**: Easily integrable and customizable for various use cases.
- **Format Support**: Nectar2P supports all file formats.
- **Command Line Interface**: `python -m nectar2p` provides simple `send` and `receive` commands with progress display.
- **Integrity & Resume**: Transfers include SHA-256 verification and can resume from partial files.

## Installation

`nectar2p` requires Python 3.6+ and depends on the `cryptography` library. Follow these steps to install the project:

```bash
# Install Nectar2P
pip install nectar2p
```

## Usage

### Overview

`nectar2p` provides two main classes for P2P file transfer:
- **NectarSender**: Used for sending files.
- **NectarReceiver**: Used for receiving files.

These classes support secure file transfer with optional encryption and NAT traversal.

### Command Line Usage

After installing the package you can use a simple CLI:

```bash
python -m nectar2p receive 0.0.0.0 5000 received.bin --resume
```

In another terminal:

```bash
python -m nectar2p send receiver_ip 5000 file.bin
```

### Basic Usage

#### File Sending (Sender)

```python
from nectar2p.nectar_sender import NectarSender

def main():
    receiver_host = "public.receiver.ip"
    receiver_port = 5000
    # optionally verify the receiver's public key
    expected_receiver_key = b"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----..."
    sender = NectarSender(receiver_host, receiver_port, enable_encryption=True,
                          expected_receiver_public_key=expected_receiver_key)

    try:
        sender.initiate_secure_connection()
        sender.send_file("path/to/your/file.txt")
    finally:
        sender.close_connection()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### File Receiving (Receiver)

```python
from nectar2p.nectar_receiver import NectarReceiver

def main():
    host = "0.0.0.0"  # Allows connection from any IP
    port = 5000
    # optionally verify the sender's public key
    expected_sender_key = b"-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----..."
    receiver = NectarReceiver(host, port, enable_encryption=True,
                              expected_sender_public_key=expected_sender_key)

    try:
        receiver.wait_for_sender()
        receiver.receive_file("path/to/save/file.txt")
    finally:
        receiver.close_connection()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Using NAT Traversal for Cross-Network Transfers

The `NectarSender` and `NectarReceiver` classes use a STUN server for NAT traversal, allowing direct connections between devices on different networks. Public IP addresses are automatically retrieved through the STUN server.
The STUN server address can be customized when creating `NATTraversal`. Be aware that the server can observe your public IP address.

### Enabling/Disabling Encryption

Encryption can be optionally enabled or disabled during file transfer. When `enable_encryption` is set to `True`, RSA and AES-GCM encryption are used. When set to `False`, files are transferred without encryption. Files are transferred in 64&nbsp;KiB chunks and each chunk is authenticated. `Connection.receive_data` enforces a maximum message size of 100&nbsp;MiB by default.

```python
# Encryption enabled
sender = NectarSender("receiver_ip", 5000, enable_encryption=True)

# Encryption disabled
receiver = NectarReceiver("0.0.0.0", 5000, enable_encryption=False)
```
