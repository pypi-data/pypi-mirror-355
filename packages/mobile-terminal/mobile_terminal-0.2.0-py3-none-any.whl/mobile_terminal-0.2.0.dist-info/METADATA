# mobile-terminal

The terminal moves with you. Access and control your terminal from any mobile device.

## What it does

mobile-terminal creates a local web server that streams your terminal output to your phone in real-time. When your terminal needs input (like Y/N prompts, passwords, or any user input), you get notified on your phone and can respond directly from there.

Perfect for:
- Long-running scripts that occasionally need input
- Remote deployments that ask for confirmation
- AI coding assistants (like Claude) that need permissions
- Any command that might interrupt your workflow

## Features

- 📱 **Real-time terminal streaming** to your phone
- 🔔 **Instant notifications** when input is needed
- ⌨️ **Send commands** from your phone
- 🚫 **Prevents laptop sleep** while running
- 🔒 **Local network only** - secure by default
- 🎯 **Zero configuration** - just run and go

## Installation

```bash
pip install mobile-terminal

# http://192.168.1.42:8080
```

### Examples

Monitor a deployment:
```bash

## How it works

1. term-cast creates a pseudo-terminal (PTY) that captures all input/output
2. Starts a local web server on port 8080
3. Your phone connects via WebSocket for real-time streaming
4. When input is detected, your phone gets notified
5. You can type responses directly from your phone
6. Laptop stays awake while term-cast is running

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- Same WiFi network for laptop and phone
- Modern web browser on phone

## Security

- **Local network only** - no data leaves your network
- **No authentication** by default - only use on trusted networks
- **Optional encryption** - use `--ssl` flag for HTTPS
- **Session isolation** - each run gets a unique session
