# HiPSter

[Spherinator](https://github.com/HITS-AIN/Spherinator) and
[HiPSter](https://github.com/HITS-AIN/HiPSter) are tools that provide explorative access
and visualization for multimodal data from extremely large astrophysical datasets, ranging from
exascale cosmological simulations to multi-billion object observational galaxy surveys.

HiPSter uses a trained model from Spherinator with a spherical latent space to create HiPS tilings
and a catalog that can be visualized interactively on the surface of a sphere using
[Aladin Lite](https://github.com/cds-astro/aladin-lite).

## Installation

```bash
pip install astro-hipster
```

## Usage

The `HiPSter` package provides a CLI to create HiPS tilings and a catalog from the spherical latent
space representation.

```bash
hipster --config <path_to_config_file>
```

For more details run `hipster --help` or check the [documentation](https://spherinator.readthedocs.io/en/latest/hipster.html#command-line-interface).
