# Lite Bootstrap

Welcome to the `lite-bootstrap` documentation!

`lite-bootstrap` assists you in creating applications with all the necessary instruments already set up.

With `lite-bootstrap`, you receive an application with lightweight built-in support for:
- `sentry`
- `prometheus`
- `opentelemetry`
- `structlog`
- `cors`
- `swagger` - with additional offline version support
- `health-checks`

Those instruments can be bootstrapped for:

- [LiteStar](integrations/litestar)
- [FastStream](integrations/faststream)
- [FastAPI](integrations/fastapi)
- [services and scripts without frameworks](integrations/free)
