Tecton is the fastest way to build operational machine learning applications. It helps automate real-time decision making like fraud detection, product recommendations, and search result ranking in production applications.

Tecton is a fully-managed feature platform built to orchestrate the complete lifecycle of features, from transformation to online serving, with enterprise-grade SLAs.

With Tecton, you can:

- Define and manage features using code in a git repository.
- Automatically compute and orchestrate batch, streaming, and real-time feature
  transformations.
- Store and serve feature data for training and inference.
- Share, discover, and manage access to features.

# Contents of the `tecton-rift-extensions` PyPI package

The `tecton-rift-extensions` PyPI package bundles core DuckDB extensions and Tecton built-in DuckDB extensions, which are used by
Tecton Rift compute engine for feature engineering workloads. For more information about Rift, see the [Tecton Rift documentation](https://www.tecton.ai/blog/introducing-rift-tectons-compute-engine/).
