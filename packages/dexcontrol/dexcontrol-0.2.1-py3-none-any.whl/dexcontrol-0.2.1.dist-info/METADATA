              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and

                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# dexcontrol

A user-friendly robot learning oriented control library implemented in Python.


## Development Guide

### Pre-commit Hooks
This repository uses pre-commit hooks to maintain high code quality standards. The hooks automatically run code formatting and linting checks before each commit, ensuring consistent code style and catching potential issues early in the development process.

To set up pre-commit:

1. Install the development dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pre-commit
   ```

2. Install the pre-commit hooks:
   ```bash
   pre-commit install
   ```


## Setup

### 1. Install dextop

First, install [dextop](https://github.com/dm-ai-core/dextop) for secure robot communication. This handles authentication of zenoh communication and robot selection when multiple robots are present.

The robot (SOC and Jetson) and your development computer must use certificates generated by the same CA. For internal Dexmate users, you can use the pre-generated `dexmate_internal_certs.zip`.

> [!TIP]
> For security reasons, find these certificates in the slack channel rather than Github. Internal certificates are removed before customer delivery.

Install the certificates (no need to unzip manually):
```shell
dextop cert unpack dexmate_internal_certs.zip
dextop cfg gen
```

Install certificates on all three devices (SOC, Jetson, and development computer). This is a one-time setup, and certificates will be stored in `~/.dexmate/comm/zenoh`.

### 2. Install pylibdexcontrol

Install [pylibdexcontrol](https://github.com/dm-ai-core/pylibdexcontrol) on the **SOC**. Start the zenoh server:
```shell
robot-server --start
```

### 3. Network Configuration

**Standard Setup**
For running dexcontrol on Jetson, no additional configuration is needed. The default network architecture looks like this:

```ASCII
Router (192.168.0.1)
    ↕
Jetson [WiFi: 192.168.0.70, Ethernet: 192.168.50.20]
    ↕
SOC [192.168.50.21 / 192.168.100.22:50000]
```

**Remote Development Setup**
You'll need additional configuration in these scenarios:
- You want to control the robot from your development computer
- The zenoh server is running on SOC
- SOC is only connected to Jetson via Ethernet (no WiFi connection)

In this case, run the following command on Jetson:
```shell
dextop node start --config ~/.dexmate/comm/zenoh/zenoh_peer_config.json5
```

This command configures Jetson to act as a network bridge:
- Jetson will route traffic between your development computer and the SOC
- Allows dexcontrol (on your computer) to communicate with pylibdexcontrol (on SOC)
- Enables control even when your computer and SOC are on different networks

## Examples

Check out the [examples](./examples) for examples.


## Changelist from V1 to V2

The primary difference between V1 and V2. After migration, the v2 will take over these files:
1. `configs/`
2. `core/`

## System Design

Dexcontrol acts as a client for the Dexmate robot. It fetches robot information and sends control commands by communicating with the robot server via the zenoh protocol.

### Units

All API units use the International System of Units (SI):
- Distance: meters (m)
- Angles: radians (rad)
- Angular velocity: radians per second (rad/s)
- Force: newtons (N)
- Torque: newton-meters (N·m)

The only exception is temperature, we use degree celsius instead of Kelvin in dexcontrol.

### Zenoh Communication Protocol

DexControl uses the following naming convention for zenoh communication:

| Name        | Type          | Example              | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `state/*`   | Topic (async) | `state/arm/left`     | Robot motor state information. DexControl handles this automatically.                             |
| `control/*` | Topic (async) | `control/torso`      | Send control commands to robot motors. Requires a control message.                                |
| `mode/*`    | Query (sync)  | `mode/arm/left`      | Set the mode of robot motors (e.g., position mode, disable a motor). Requires a query message.    |
| `system/*`  | Query (sync)  | `system/clear_error` | System-level commands (e.g., reboot components, handle emergency stop). Requires a query message. |
| `info/*`    | Get (sync)    | `info/version`       | Retrieve information from the robot. No query message needed and no impact on the physical robot. |

The final name of zenoh topic is `{robot_name}/{topic_name}`, e.g. `dm-d17edf944753/state/hand/left`.

## Documentation

Documentation generation tools and scripts are located in the `docgen/` directory. To build documentation:

```bash
# Install documentation dependencies
pip install -e ".[docs]"

# Build HTML documentation
python docgen/build_docs.py

# Build GitBook documentation
python docgen/build_docs.py --gitbook
```

For detailed documentation setup and configuration, see [`docgen/DOCUMENTATION_SETUP.md`](docgen/DOCUMENTATION_SETUP.md).
