Textual-Window is an extension library for [Textual](https://github.com/Textualize/textual).

It provides a Window widget, along with an included WindowBar and WindowSwitcher, that makes it extremely
easy to create a desktop GUI-like experience inside of a TUI built with Textual.

Window widgets are floating, draggable, resizable, snappable, closable, and you can even cycle through them in a manner similar to alt-tab. It's like a mini desktop inside of your terminal. (Is it ridiculous? Yes, yes it is. But is it awesome? Also yes.)

## Features

- Drag, resize, and maximize windows. Close windows with ctrl+w.
- Windows can focus, and highlight to show which one is focused. Controls are passed from the highlighted window to its inner scrolling container.
- Included fully-automatic Window Bar (aka Task Bar). Don't worry about keeping track of the windows. Just compose and go. The library will track them for you.
- Included Window Switcher, to cycle window focus in a manner similar to alt-tab. The most recently focused window is always at the start (left side).
- Set the window's min and max size through Textual CSS as you normally would, and the window will respect those settings when resizing. Resizing can also be disabled per window.
- Windows snap to the terminal by default, toggle this on/off in real-time.
- WindowBar can toggle the dock between top and bottom of the screen in real-time.
- Window Bar has right-click context menus, one for each window, as well as a global context menu with options such as close/open all or snap/unsnap all.
- Set the window's starting location on the screen using plain descriptions (ie. right + bottom), as well as whether to initialize open or closed.
- An optional hamburger menu for custom callbacks - The window has a 'menu_options' argument. Pass in a dictionary of functions (label + callback) and these functions will appear in that window's hamburger menu. (If nothing is passed in, the menu is not shown).
- Smooth fade in/out animation adds a convincing touch.
- Create windows in all 3 ways textual supports - context manager, passing in a list of children, and custom Window objects.
- ...and many small QoL things too numerous to list here.

See the documentation for more details.
