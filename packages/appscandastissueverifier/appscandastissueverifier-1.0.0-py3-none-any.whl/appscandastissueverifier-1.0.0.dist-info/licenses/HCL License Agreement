However, HCLSoftware is not obligated to provide such assistance unless HCLSoftware and Licensee enter a separate written agreement under which HCLSoftware agrees to provide to Licensee that type of support, which are also provided by HCLSoftware without any warranty, in this Agreement. In any event, HCLSoftware uses information about errors and problems to improve its products and services, and assist with its provision of related support offerings.

9.0 AUDIT Customer agrees that HCLSoftware may annually audit relevant books and records (including electronic records), devices, computers, servers, and systems of Customer, its Affiliates, consultants, service providers and contractors (collectively, "Customer Entity(ies)"), relating to the Program in order to verify the use of the Program in compliance with this Agreement. HCLSoftware may make copies of any such books and records to the extent necessary to verify Customer's compliance with the terms hereof. HCLSoftware may conduct the audit itself or at its option engage an independent third party to do such audit. The audit may be conducted at any sites of Customer Entities, where the Program is installed, used or accessed from, including remotely. HCLSoftware shall bear its own costs in connection with an audit. HCLSoftware will provide fifteen (15) calendar days' notice prior to an audit, except where there is a reasonable cause to suspect that there is an infringement of intellectual property rights, in which case only two (2) business days' notice will be required. Any such audit will be performed during Customer Entity's normal business hours and in a manner that minimizes the disruption to its business. Customer Entities shall provide all assistance reasonably necessary for HCL SOFTWARE to carry out such audit. If the audit reveals underpayments, Customer shall promptly make such payments. If the audit reveals under-reporting of usage, Customer shall promptly pay for the differentials at HCLSoftware's then list price for the Program. HCLSoftware's rights and remedies in this subsections shall be without prejudice to other rights and remedies HCLSoftware has under this Agreement, at law or in equity. HCLSoftware's rights under this provision shall survive any termination or expiry of this Agreement for two years.

HCLSoftware may (i) terminate the Licenses to the Programs if Customer fails to pay the applicable Fees due within thirty (30) days of receipt of written notice from HCLSoftware of non-payment; (ii) terminate Licenses to the Programs, and/or this Agreement, without notice or cure period, if Customer violates the intellectual property rights of HCLSoftware, its Affiliates or its licensors, or uses the Program outside the scope of the License; or (iii) terminate all Licenses and this Agreement in whole or part if Customer commits any other material breach of this Agreement and fails to cure the breach within thirty (30) days after HCLSoftware notifies Customer in writing of the breach. Upon termination of a License, (a) Customer will immediately uninstall and discontinue use of the relevant Program, (b) upon HCLSoftware's request, Customer will immediately return such Program to HCLSoftware, together with all related Documentation and copies or certify its destruction in writing, and (c) all Support obligations of HCLSoftware under the Agreement, if any, will come to an end.
