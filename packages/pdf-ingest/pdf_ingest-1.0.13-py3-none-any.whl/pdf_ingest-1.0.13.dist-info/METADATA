MA: I was wondering though if the filename could have a pre-extension based on language like *-EN.txt
MA: Or *-RUS.txt, etc.
MA: Like, if it's easy for your program to realize what language it is

ME: that's trivial
ME: but how is your AI going to make sense out of different languages?

MA: We are just gonna archive non-English for now, and only process English
