# 1. Introduction
The level-2 time-variable gravity fields obtained from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its Follow-On (GRACE-FO) mission are widely used in multi-discipline geo-science studies. However, the post-processing of those gravity fields to obtain a desired signal is rather challenging for users that are not familiar with the level-2 products. In addition, the error assessment/quantification of those derived signals, which is of increasing demand in science application, is still a challenging issue even among the professional GRACE(-FO) users. In this effort, the common post-processing steps and the assessment of complicated error (uncertainty) of GRACE(-FO), are integrated into an open-source, cross-platform and Python-based toolbox called SAGEA (SAtellite Gravity Error Assessment). With diverse options, SAGEA provides flexibility to generate signal along with the full error from level-2 products, so that any non-expert user can easily obtain advanced experience of GRACE(-FO) processing.
