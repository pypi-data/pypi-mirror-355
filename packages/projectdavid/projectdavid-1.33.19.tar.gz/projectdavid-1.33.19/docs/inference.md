# Inference

## Overview

Inference is the final stage of the Entities API workflow, where the assistant processes a prompt and generates a reply. This stage is where the magic happens, and the assistantâ€™s intelligence is put to the test. Inference can be performed on edge devices or in the cloud, depending on your specific requirements and constraints. Our API supports both options, allowing you to choose the best approach for your use case.
