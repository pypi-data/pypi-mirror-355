# BatchFactory

Composable, cache‑aware pipelines for **parallel LLM workflows**, API calls, and dataset generation.

> **Status — `v0.3` alpha.** More robust and battle-tested on small projects. Still evolving quickly — APIs may shift.

## Install

```bash
pip install batchfactory            # latest tag
pip install --upgrade batchfactory  # grab the newest patch
```

---

## Quick‑start

```python
import batchfactory as bf
from batchfactory.op import *

project = bf.CacheFolder("quickstart", 1, 0, 0)
broker  = bf.brokers.ConcurrentLLMCallBroker(project["cache/llm_broker.jsonl"])

PROMPT = """
Write a poem about {keyword}.
"""

g = bf.Graph()
g |= ReadMarkdownLines("./demo_data/greek_mythology_stories.md")
g |= Shuffle(42) | TakeFirstN(5)
g |= GenerateLLMRequest(PROMPT, model="gpt-4o-mini@openai")
g |= ConcurrentLLMCall(project["cache/llm_call.jsonl"],broker)
g |= ExtractResponseText()
g |= WriteMarkdownEntries(project["out/poems.md"])

g.execute(dispatch_brokers=True)
```

Run it twice – everything after the first run is served from the on‑disk ledger.

## Why BatchFactory?  **Three killer moves**

| 🏭 Mass data distillation & cleanup | 🎭 Multi-agent, multi-round workflows | 🌲 Hierarchical spawning (`ListParallel`) |
|---|---|---|
| Chain `GenerateLLMRequest → ConcurrentLLMCall → ExtractResponseText` after keyword / file sources to **mass-produce**, **filter**, or **polish** datasets—millions of Q&A rows, code explanations, translation pairs—with built-in caching & cost tracking. | With `Repeat`, `If`, `While`, and chat helpers, you can script complex role-based collaborations—e.g. *Junior Translator → Senior Editor → QA → Revision*—and run full multi-agent, multi-turn simulations in just a few lines of code. Ideal for workflows inspired by **TransAgents**, **MATT**, or **ChatDev**. | `ListParallel` breaks a complex item into fine-grained subtasks, runs them **concurrently**, then reunites the outputs—ideal for **long-text summarisation**, **RAG chunking**, or any tree-structured pipeline. |

### Spawn snippet (Text Segmentation)

```python
g |= Apply(lambda x: split_text(label_line_numbers(x)), "text", "text_segments")
spawn_chain = AskLLM(LABEL_SEG_PROMPT, "labels", 1)
spawn_chain |= Apply(text_to_integer_list, "labels")
g | ListParallel(spawn_chain, "text_segments", "text", "labels", "labels")
g |= Apply(flatten_list, "labels")
g |= Apply(split_text_by_line_labels, ["text", "labels"], "text_segments")
g |= ExplodeList(["directory", "text_segments"], ["directory", "text"])
```

---

### Loop snippet (Role‑Playing)

```python
Teacher = Character("teacher_name", "You are a teacher named {teacher_name}. "+FORMAT_REQ)
Student = Character("student_name", "You are a student named {student_name}. "+FORMAT_REQ)

g = bf.Graph()
g |= ReadMarkdownLines("./demo_data/greek_mythology_stories.md") | TakeFirstN(1)
g |= SetField("teacher_name", "Teacher","student_name", "Student")

g |= Teacher("Please introduce the text from {directory} titled {keyword}.", 0)
loop_body = Student("Please ask questions or respond.", 1)
loop_body |= Teacher("Please respond to the student or continue explaining.", 2)
g |= Repeat(loop_body, 3)
g |= Teacher("Please summarize.", 3)
g |= ChatHistoryToText(template="**{role}**: {content}\n\n")
g |= WriteMarkdownEntries(project["out/roleplay.md"])
```

## Core concepts (one‑liner view)


| Term          | Story in one sentence                                                                                                                              |               |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- |
| **Entry**     | Tiny record with immutable `idx`, mutable `data`, auto‑incrementing `rev`.                                                                         |               |
| **Op**        | Atomic node; compose with `|`or`wire()`. |
| **Graph**     | A chain of `Op`s wired together — supports flexible pipelines and subgraphs.                                                                       |               |
| **Executor**  | Internal engine that tracks graph state, manages batching, resumption, and broker dispatch. Created automatically when you call `graph.execute()`. |               |
| **Broker**    | Pluggable engine for expensive or async jobs (LLM APIs, search, human labelers).                                                                   |               |
| **Ledger**    | Append‑only JSONL backing each broker & graph — enables instant resume and transparent caching.                                                    |               |
| **execute()** | High-level command that runs the graph: creates an `Executor`, resumes from cache, and dispatches brokers as needed.                               |               |

| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **1\_quickstart**         | Linear LLM transform with caching and auto‑resuming |

| **3\_text\_segmentation** | Divide‑and‑conquer pipeline for text segmentation   |

## ⚙️ Broker & Cache Highlights

* Every expensive call is **hashed** to a unique `job_idx` — repeated prompts are automatically **deduplicated**.
* Control how failures propagate with `BrokerFailureBehavior = RETRY | STAY | EMIT`.
* On restart, `execute()` resumes from cached state and dispatches **only missing or incomplete jobs** — no manual checkpoints needed.

---

## 🛣️ Roadmap → v0.4

* Native **vector store** and **semantic search** nodes
* Streamlined **cost tracking** and **progress reporting**
