# Installation

The pygis package has many dependencies, such as [GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org), [rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/), and [localtileserver](https://github.com/banesullivan/localtileserver). These optional dependencies can sometimes be a challenge to install, especially on Windows. Therefore, we advise you to closely follow the recommendations below to avoid installation problems.

## Installing with uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) us an extremely fast Python package and project manager, written in Rust. It is designed to be a drop-in replacement for pip. You can install `pygis` using `uv` as follows:

```bash
uv pip install pygis
uv pip install gdal pyproj --find-links https://girder.github.io/large_image_wheels
```

## Installing with Anaconda/Miniconda

To install pygis and all its dependencies, we recommend you use the [conda](https://conda.io/en/latest) package manager. This can be obtained by installing the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution) (a free Python distribution for data science), or through [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) (minimal distribution only containing Python and the conda package manager). See also the [installation docs](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html) for more information on how to install Anaconda or Miniconda locally.

### Using the conda-forge channel

pygis is available on the [conda-forge](https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/pygis) channel, a community effort that provides [conda packages](https://conda-forge.org) for a wide range of software.

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pygis
```

### Creating a new conda environment

Creating a new environment is not strictly necessary, but given that some pygis dependencies might have a version conflict with other geospatial packages in an existing conda environment, it is a good practice to install pygis and its dependencies in a clean environment starting fresh.

The following commands create a new conda environment with the name `geo` and install pygis and its dependencies (e.g., GeoPandas, localtileserver) in it:

```bash
conda create -n geo python=3.12
conda activate geo
conda install pygis -c conda-forge
```

**Important note:** If you are using Windows, we advise you to closely follow the installation instructions above to install GeoPandas from the default conda channel (`conda install geopandas`) rather than from the conda-forge channel. This can avoid a potential `spatialindex_c-64.dll` error when using GeoPandas ([source](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/issues/1812)). If you are using Linux or macOS, it is okay to install all pygis dependencies from the conda-forge channel with the following command:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge pygis
```

### Using Mamba

When installing packages using the conda package manager, sometimes it can take a while for conda to resolve dependencies. If it takes too long or fails to resolve dependencies, you can try using the [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest) package manager to install pygis and its dependencies. Mamba is a fast, robust, and cross-platform package manager. It runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, and is fully compatible with conda packages and supports most of condaâ€™s commands. Once Mamba is installed in a conda environment, you can then simply replace any `conda` command with `mamba`. For example, to install pygis and its dependencies with Mamba, you can use the following commands:

```bash
conda create -n geo python=3.12
conda activate geo
conda install -c conda-forge mamba
mamba install -c conda-forge gdal
mamba install -c conda-forge pygis
```

## Installing with pip

pygis is also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/pygis). It can be installed with pip using the following command:

```bash
pip install --find-links=https://girder.github.io/large_image_wheels --no-cache GDAL
pip install pygis
```

All optional dependencies of pygis are listed in [requirements_dev.txt](https://github.com/opengeos/pygis/blob/master/requirements_dev.txt).

## Installing from source

You may install the latest development version by cloning the GitHub repository with [Git](https://git-scm.com) and using pip to install from the local directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/opengeos/pygis.git
cd pygis
pip install .
```

It is also possible to install the latest development version directly from the GitHub repository with:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/opengeos/pygis.git
```

## Upgrading pygis

If you have installed pygis before and want to upgrade to the latest version, you can run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install -U pygis
```

If you use conda, you can update pygis to the latest version by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
conda update -c conda-forge pygis
```
