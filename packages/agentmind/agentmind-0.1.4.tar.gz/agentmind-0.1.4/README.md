## Why agentmind?

Every AI agent needs memory. Today, developers hack together vector DBs, prompt engineering, and custom storage. We make it simple.

```python
from agentmind import Memory

# Initialize memory for your AI assistant
memory = Memory(local_mode=True)

# Store facts during conversation
memory.remember("My name is Alex")
memory.remember("I live in New York")
memory.remember("I'm vegetarian")
memory.remember("I have a meeting at 3pm today")

# Later when you ask for help...
context = memory.recall("restaurant")
# Returns: ["I'm vegetarian"]

context = memory.recall("schedule today")
# Returns: ["I have a meeting at 3pm today"]
```

That's it. No vector DBs to manage. No complex prompt engineering. Just memory that works.

## Features

- ⚡ **Fast** - Sub-200ms recall latency
- 🔒 **Secure** - Optional E2E encryption, GDPR compliant
- 📊 **Smart** - Semantic search, auto-summarization, importance ranking

## Installation

```bash
pip install agentmind
```

## Framework Integrations

### With LangChain

```python
from langchain import ConversationChain
from langchain.llms import OpenAI
from agentmind.integrations.langchain import AgentMindMemory

# Use AgentMind as LangChain's memory - persists across sessions!
memory = AgentMindMemory(local_mode=True, user_id="user_123")

chain = ConversationChain(
    llm=OpenAI(),
    memory=memory
)

# First conversation
chain.predict(input="I'm working on a React app with TypeScript")
chain.predict(input="I need help with state management")

# Later session - the AI remembers!
response = chain.predict(input="What technology stack am I using?")
# Output: "You're working on a React app with TypeScript. Last time we discussed
# state management options for your project."
```

### With OpenAI

```python
from openai import OpenAI
from agentmind import Memory
from agentmind.integrations.openai import enhance_with_memory

client = OpenAI()
memory = Memory(local_mode=True, user_id="founder_1234")

# Track founder's journey and challenges
memory.remember("Building a fintech startup focused on small business lending")
memory.remember("Team of 8 people, raised $2M seed round last month")
memory.remember("Revenue goal: $1M ARR by end of year")

# Founder asks for strategic advice
messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Should I hire a compliance officer or outsource SOC2?"}
]

# Automatically inject relevant context
enhanced_messages = enhance_with_memory(messages, memory)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=enhanced_messages
)
# AI response considers the startup's size (8 people), funding ($2M), and revenue goals
```

## Quick Start

### Customer Support Bot

```python
from agentmind import Memory

# Initialize memory for each customer
memory = Memory(local_mode=True, user_id="customer_1234")

# During first support conversation
memory.remember("Customer has premium subscription since 2023")
memory.remember("Uses our API for e-commerce integration")
memory.remember("Had billing issue last month - resolved with $50 credit")
memory.remember("Prefers email communication over phone")

# Two weeks later, customer contacts support again...
context = memory.recall("billing")
print(context)
# ["Had billing issue last month - resolved with $50 credit"]

# Agent now knows the history and can provide better service
```

### Personal AI Assistant

```python
from agentmind import Memory

# Your AI assistant remembers your preferences and context
memory = Memory(local_mode=True, user_id="john_1234")

# Throughout the week, you mention various things
memory.remember("I have a big presentation on Friday to the board")
memory.remember("Need to pick up dry cleaning before Thursday")
memory.remember("Allergic to shellfish - avoid in restaurant recommendations")
memory.remember("Prefer morning meetings, not good after 3pm")

# Later when you ask for help...
context = memory.recall("presentation Friday")
# AI knows about your board presentation and can help accordingly

context = memory.recall("restaurant")
# AI remembers your shellfish allergy for recommendations
```

### Sales CRM Integration

```python
from agentmind import Memory
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()
memory = Memory(local_mode=True, user_id="prospect_acme_corp")

# Track prospect interactions over time
memory.remember("Company: ACME Corp, 500 employees, SaaS industry")
memory.remember("Pain point: Manual data entry taking 20 hours/week")
memory.remember("Budget: $50k annually for automation tools")
memory.remember("Decision maker: Sarah (CTO), influences: Mike (CFO)")
memory.remember("Competitor evaluation: considering Zapier and Microsoft Power Automate")

# Before your follow-up call, get context
context = memory.recall("ACME Corp pain points budget")

# Use context in your sales conversation
messages = [
    {"role": "system", "content": f"Context: {context}"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Draft a follow-up email focusing on ROI"}
]

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=messages
)
# AI crafts personalized email mentioning their 20hr/week pain point and $50k budget
```

## Advanced Features

### Semantic Search
```python
# Find memories by meaning, not just keywords
memories = memory.recall(
    "technical challenges",
    strategy="semantic",
    limit=5
)
```

### Memory Management
```python
# Organize memories
memory.remember("Q4 revenue target: $1M", metadata={
    "category": "business",
    "importance": "high",
    "expires": "2024-12-31"
})

# Batch operations
memories = [
    {"content": "Launched MVP", "timestamp": "2024-01-15"},
    {"content": "First customer", "timestamp": "2024-02-01"}
]
memory.remember_batch(memories)

# Forget when needed
memory.forget(memory_id="mem_abc123")
memory.forget_before(date="2023-01-01")
```

### Session Management
```python
# Auto-summarize conversations
summary = memory.summarize_session(session_id="chat_123")

# Export user data (GDPR)
data = memory.export_user_data(user_id="user_123")
```
