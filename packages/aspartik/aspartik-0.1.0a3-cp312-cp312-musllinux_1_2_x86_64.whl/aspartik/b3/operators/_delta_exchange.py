    This operator is analogous to BEAST2's `DeltaExchangeOperator`.  It picks
    two random dimensions from a set list of parameters, a random delta, and
    increments one of them by delta and decrements the other one.  The ratio of
    the decrement can be controlled with the `weights` vector: the value of the
    decrement is `delta * weights[inc_param] / weights[dec_param]`.
