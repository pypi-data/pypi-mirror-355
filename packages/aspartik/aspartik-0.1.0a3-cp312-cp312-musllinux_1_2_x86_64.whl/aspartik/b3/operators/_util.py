    The BEAST2 calculates the ratio and scaling as follows:

    - Choose a random number between `factor` and `1 / factor`.
    - The new value is `low + scale * (high - low)`.
    - The Hastings ratio is a logarithm of `scale`.

    For non-internal distributions this function does a similar thing: the
    scale is selected on `(0, inf)` (with exponentiation rescaling for
    full-line distributions) and the rest of the algorithm is the same as
    BEAST2.

    The distributions defined on an interval are rescaled to `(low, high)`.
    Since the target distribution is the same and we're just stretching it, I
    believe the Hastings ratio should always be 0.

    Returns tuple of the new point and the Hastings ratio of the move.
