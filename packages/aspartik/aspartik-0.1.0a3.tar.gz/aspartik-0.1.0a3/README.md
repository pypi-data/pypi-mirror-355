# Aspartik

Aspartik is a computational biology toolkit inspired by [BioPython] and
[SciPy].  It's goal is to provide a suit of utilities for working with
genetic data and phylogenetic simulations.

Aspartik was initially created for the sake of [`b3`], a Bayesian
phylogenetic inference engine.  Thus, most of the non-`b3` modules are
currently very raw and only expose the functionality required by `b3`.
But I hope that as development continues they'll become broadly useful.
