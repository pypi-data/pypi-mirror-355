# VenomLearn: Interactive Python Learning

VenomLearn is an interactive Python learning package designed to make learning Python fun, engaging, and accessible for beginners and intermediate learners. The package provides a terminal-based interface with colorful visuals, interactive exercises, and progress tracking.

## Features

- 🎯 **Progressive Learning Path**: From beginner to advanced Python concepts
- 🧩 **Interactive Exercises**: Practice what you learn with hands-on coding challenges
- 📊 **Progress Tracking**: Keep track of your learning journey
- 🎮 **Gamified Experience**: Earn badges and achievements as you learn
- 🎨 **Rich Terminal UI**: Colorful and engaging interface

## Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI
pip install VenomLearn

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/VenomLearn/VenomLearn.git
cd VenomLearn
pip install -e .
```

## Requirements

VenomLearn requires Python 3.7 or higher and the following packages:

- rich>=10.0.0
- questionary>=1.10.0
- pyfiglet>=0.8.post1
- tqdm>=4.62.0

## Usage

After installing VenomLearn, you can start the interactive learning tool in two ways:

### 1. Launch from the Terminal (if installed as a script)
```bash
venomlearn
```

### 2. Run as a Python Module
```bash
python -m VenomLearn.main
```

Both commands will launch the interactive terminal UI where you can select your difficulty level, view your learning roadmap, and begin your Python journey.

### 3. Import and Use Programmatically (Advanced)
You can also import specific modules from the package in your own Python scripts:
```python
from VenomLearn.topics import basics, advanced

# Start a lesson directly
basics.start_lesson()
advanced.start_lesson()
```

For most users, launching from the terminal or as a module is recommended.

## Topics Covered

- **Python Basics**: Variables, data types, input/output operations
- **Control Flow**: If-else statements, loops, conditional expressions
- **Functions**: Function definitions, parameters, return values, scope
- **Data Structures**: Lists, dictionaries, sets, tuples, comprehensions
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Classes, objects, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Modules and Packages**: Importing, creating modules, package structure
- **Advanced Topics**: Decorators, generators, context managers, error handling
