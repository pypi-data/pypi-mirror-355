No significant changes.

## 3.0.0 (2023-01-05)

- Moved `xor_cipher.extension` imports into `xor_cipher` prelude instead of `xor_cipher.core`.
  This makes it easy to generate proper documentation and
  allows to test both python and cython implementations.

## 2.3.0 (2022-10-29)

### Changes

- Transferred the project to the [`xor-cipher`](https://github.com/xor-cipher) organization.

## 2.2.2 (2022-10-25)

### Features

- Fixed the memory leak for functions which created copies of the initial buffer.

## 2.2.1 (2022-10-25)

### Features

- Optimized the process of memory copying (both in performance and memory usage).

## 2.2.0 (2022-10-25)

### Features

- Added `py.typed` file to signify that the library is typed.

## 2.1.0 (2022-10-25)

No significant changes.

- Renamed `xor_cyclic -> cyclic_xor`.
- Renamed `xor_cyclic_unsafe -> cyclic_xor_unsafe`.
- Renamed `xor_static_str -> xor_string`.
