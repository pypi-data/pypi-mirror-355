Biologically Guided Variational Inference for Interpretable Multimodal Single-Cell Integration
=============================================================================================

**NetworkVI** is a sparse deep generative model designed for the integration and interpretation of multimodal single-cell data.
NetworkVI models gene-gene interactions inferred from topological associated domains and utilizes the structure of gene ontology (GO) to aggregate gene embeddings to cell embeddings, enhancing the interpretability at the gene and GO-term level.
NetworkVI can be used for modality imputation, reference-to-query mapping and aids in identifying modality- and cell type-specific signatures via interpretability.
NetworkVI will support researchers in interpreting cellular disease mechanisms, guiding biomarker discovery, and ultimately aiding the development of targeted therapies in large-scale single-cell multimodal atlases.
