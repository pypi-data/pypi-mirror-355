"""Cluster colors with median cut.

Repeatedly subdivide the color space by splitting along the longest axis (not
constrained to x, y, or z. splits with the optimal plane).

This median cut has a few optimizations, so it will produce a nice heirarchal set of
clusters with some modification, though at this point no hierarchies are preserved.
The idea is to use this to reduce the number of colors in an image to around 512.
From 512, they can be again merged into a single cluster and again split to find a
starting point for kmedians.
