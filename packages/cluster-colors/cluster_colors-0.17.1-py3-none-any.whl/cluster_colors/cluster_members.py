"""Members of a cluster represented as a list of vectors with a proximity matrix.

The clustering algorithms in this package do not calculate proximity, but only refer
to a given proximity matrix. This means that more expensive proximity calculations
can be used with the minimum penalty. Each Supercluster and the Clusters it contains
share a single Members instance. This instance holds all vector information and a few
variants of the proximity matrix. A Cluster is defined by the indices of the members
it contains.

        The `weights` argument is optional, but each member must have a weight. If
        `weights` is None, the weights are assumed to be the last axis of the vectors
        argument. This is consistent with `stacked_vectors` or image colors as
        `(r,g,b,a)`. If weights is a scalar, all members are given that weight. This
        is useful for clustering non-color vectors or other instances where all
        vectors should be treated with the same priority.

        The vectors must be sorted in case any members has equal proximity to
        multiple centers. When this happens, the centroid with the lowest
        lexigraphical order is chosen.

        Init will sort input vectors and sort any proximity matrix passed to align to
        the sorted vectors.

        Init will also stack vectors to remove any duplicates, but *cannot* update an
        input pmatrix to match. If you pass identical vectors and a pmatrix, you will
