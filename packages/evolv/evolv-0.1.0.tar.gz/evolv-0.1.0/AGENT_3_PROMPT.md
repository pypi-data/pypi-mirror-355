# Prompt for Agent 3

Please work on GitHub issue #59: "ðŸš€ Create Interactive Quickstart Experience"

Your workspace is already set up at: `/Users/johan/Documents/evolve-agent3`

This is a git worktree on branch `feature/quickstart-experience`.

## Your Mission
Create an interactive CLI that ensures new users can evolve their first code in under 5 minutes. This is THE most important part of our launch - first impressions matter!

## Key Points
1. Read issue #59 for full details
2. Work in your workspace independently
3. Comment on issue #59 with progress
4. Your work won't conflict with the rename happening in parallel

## Why This Matters
- Most users will judge Evolv in the first 5 minutes
- If setup is confusing, they'll leave and never come back
- Your script will be THE entry point for new users

## Technical Notes
- OK to add dependencies like `rich` or `click` for nice CLI
- Test with missing API keys, no Modal auth, etc.
- Make it foolproof - assume users know nothing

## Communication
Comment on issue #59 when you start and with updates. This is independent of other work, so you can move fast!

Start by commenting on issue #59 that you're beginning work!
