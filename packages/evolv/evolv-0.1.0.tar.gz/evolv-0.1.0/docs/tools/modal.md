# Modal

Modal is a serverless platform designed to make it easy to run Python code in the cloud, from simple functions to complex machine learning workflows, without managing infrastructure. It offers features like effortless scaling, GPU access, scheduled functions, and web endpoints.

## Core Concepts of Modal Python API

Modal's Python API allows you to define and manage your cloud functions directly within your Python scripts.

1.  **Stub (`modal.Stub`)**:
    *   The main entrypoint for a Modal application. You define all your Modal objects (functions, images, secrets, etc.) on a stub.
    *   *Example:*
        ```python
        import modal

        stub = modal.Stub(name="my-modal-app")
        ```

2.  **Image (`modal.Image`)**:
    *   Defines the execution environment for your functions. You can specify Python versions, install pip packages, or even use custom Dockerfiles.
    *   *Example (Debian Slim with Python 3.10 and specific packages):*
        ```python
        my_image = modal.Image.debian_slim(python_version="3.10")                               .pip_install(["requests", "numpy"])                               .apt_install(["git"])
        ```
    *   You can also define images from existing Docker Hub images or local Dockerfiles.

3.  **Functions (`@stub.function()`)**:
    *   The primary way to define code that runs in Modal. Decorate a Python function with `@stub.function()`.
    *   You can specify resources like GPUs, memory, attach an image, secrets, and network file systems.
    *   *Example (a simple function):*
        ```python
        @stub.function(image=my_image)
        def square(x):
            print("Running square function in Modal!")
            return x * x
        ```
    *   *Example (a function requiring a GPU):*
        ```python
        # This assumes you have a GPU available in your Modal account configuration
        @stub.function(gpu="any", image=my_image.pip_install(["torch"]))
        def process_with_gpu(data):
            import torch
            # ... do GPU work ...
            return "processed with " + str(torch.cuda.get_device_name())
        ```

4.  **Web Endpoints (`@stub.web_endpoint()`)**:
    *   Deploy a function as a publicly accessible web service (HTTP/HTTPS).
    *   Useful for creating APIs or simple web UIs.
    *   *Example:*
        ```python
        @stub.web_endpoint(method="GET")
        def my_api(value: int = 0):
            return {"doubled_value": value * 2}
        ```

5.  **Scheduled Functions (`@stub.schedule()`)**:
    *   Run functions on a recurring schedule (e.g., cron jobs).
    *   *Example (runs daily at midnight UTC):*
        ```python
        @stub.function(schedule=modal.Cron("0 0 * * *"))
        def daily_job():
            print("Running my daily scheduled job!")
        ```

6.  **Secrets (`modal.Secret`)**:
    *   Securely manage API keys and other sensitive information. You create secrets via the Modal UI or CLI, and then attach them to functions.
    *   *Example:*
        ```python
        # Assuming a secret named "my-openai-api-key" is created in Modal
        @stub.function(secrets=[modal.Secret.from_name("my-openai-api-key")])
        def call_openai():
            import os
            import openai
            openai.api_key = os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]
            # ... call OpenAI ...
        ```

7.  **Network File Systems (`modal.NetworkFileSystem`)**:
    *   Persistent storage that can be shared across function invocations and deployments. Useful for datasets, model weights, etc.
    *   *Example:*
        ```python
        # Define a network file system
        my_data_store = modal.NetworkFileSystem.persisted("my-shared-data")

        @stub.function(network_file_systems={"/root/data": my_data_store})
        def process_data():
            # /root/data is now a persistent shared directory
            with open("/root/data/some_file.txt", "a") as f:
                f.write("Hello from Modal NFS!\n")
        ```

## Running and Deploying Modal Apps

*   **Running Locally (for development/testing):**
    *   You typically run a Modal script directly with `python your_script.py`. Functions decorated with `@stub.local_entrypoint()` can be used as main execution points.
    *   Alternatively, `modal run your_script.py` can be used to invoke functions or serve web endpoints.
    *   *Example (`local_entrypoint`):*
        ```python
        @stub.local_entrypoint()
        def main():
            # Call functions directly for testing
            print(square.remote(10)) # Runs in Modal
            print(square.local(5))   # Runs locally if possible

            # To test a web endpoint locally:
            # modal serve your_script.py
        ```

*   **Deploying:**
    *   To make your app (e.g., web endpoints, scheduled functions) permanently available:
        ```bash
        modal deploy your_script.py
        ```
    *   This creates a persistent deployment in Modal.

## Installation and Setup

1.  **Install Modal CLI:**
    ```bash
    pip install modal-client
    ```
2.  **Authenticate:**
    ```bash
    modal token new
    ```
    This will open a browser window for authentication.

## Relevance to this Project

Modal can be extremely useful for this project if it involves:
- **Scalable computations:** Running many tasks in parallel, processing large datasets.
- **Machine learning:** Training models, running inference (especially with GPUs).
- **Background jobs:** Offloading long-running tasks.
- **Scheduled tasks:** Automating periodic operations.
- **Deploying APIs:** Quickly creating web services from Python functions.
- **Avoiding infrastructure management:** Focusing on code rather than servers.

By leveraging Modal's Python API, you can easily extend the capabilities of this project with cloud-based resources and serverless functions.
