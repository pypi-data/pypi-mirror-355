# Aider

Aider is a command-line chat tool that allows you to code with AI, right in your terminal. It's designed to work closely with your local git repository, making it easy to iterate on code, apply changes, and commit them. Aider is particularly effective for tasks like refactoring, adding new features, writing tests, and generating documentation for existing codebases.

## How Aider Works

When you chat with Aider, it intelligently gathers context from your codebase. You can specify which files Aider should focus on. It then uses this context to understand your requests and generate code changes. Aider can directly edit your local files according to your instructions or its suggestions. Because it's integrated with git, you can easily review changes before committing them.

## Key Features

- **Direct Code Editing:** Aider can modify your existing files.
- **Git Integration:** Works with your git repository, allowing you to easily commit changes. It can also auto-commit changes if desired.
- **Contextual Understanding:** You specify which files are relevant to the task at hand.
- **Versatile:** Useful for a wide range of coding tasks, from simple edits to complex feature development.

## Common Aider Commands

Here are some of the most frequently used Aider commands. You type these directly into the chat prompt after starting Aider.

- **`/add <file_path_or_glob_pattern> ...`**: Adds one or more files to the chat session. Aider will use these files as context for its responses and can edit them.
    - *Example:* `/add src/main.py src/utils/*.py`

- **`/drop <file_path_or_glob_pattern> ...`**: Removes one or more files from the chat session. Aider will no longer consider these files as primary context.
    - *Example:* `/drop tests/test_old_feature.py`

- **`/ls`**: Lists all files currently in the chat session.

- **`/git auto-commit`**: Toggles auto-commit mode. When enabled, Aider will automatically commit changes it makes. It's often useful to leave this off initially to review changes.
    - *Example:* `/git auto-commit` (toggles the current state)

- **`/git diff`**: Shows the diff of the pending changes Aider has made to your files. Useful for reviewing before committing.

- **`/run <command>`**: Allows you to run a shell command. For example, you can run tests or a linter.
    - *Example:* `/run pytest -k my_test_function`

- **`/tokens`**: Shows the token count for the current conversation history and the files added to the chat. Helps in understanding context window limits.

- **`/undo`**: Reverts the last set of changes Aider made.

- **`/help`**: Shows a list of available commands.

## Basic Usage Workflow

1.  **Start Aider:** Open your terminal, navigate to your project's root directory, and type `aider`.
    ```bash
    aider
    ```
2.  **Add Files:** Use the `/add` command to tell Aider which files you're working on.
    ```
    /add my_file.py another_file.py
    ```
3.  **Chat and Code:** Ask Aider to make changes, explain code, write new functions, etc.
    *Prompt example:* "Refactor the `process_data` function in `my_file.py` to be more efficient and add error handling."
4.  **Review Changes:** If Aider proposes changes, it will show you a diff or ask for permission to apply them. Use `/git diff` to see uncommitted changes.
5.  **Apply/Reject Changes:** Aider will typically ask if you want to apply the changes to your files.
6.  **Commit:** If you're happy with the changes and haven't used auto-commit, commit them using your standard git workflow or ask Aider to commit them.

## Relevance to this Project

Aider can be a powerful assistant for developing and maintaining this project. Use it to:
- Quickly implement new features based on descriptions.
- Refactor existing code for clarity or performance.
- Generate unit tests for new or existing modules.
- Write or update documentation (like this file!).
- Understand parts of the codebase by asking Aider to explain them.
