# New Task for Agent 1

Great job on the rename! Now I have another critical task for you.

**Please work on GitHub issue #62: "ðŸ§ª Validate All Examples Work with Evolv"**

Your workspace at `/Users/johan/Documents/evolve-agent1` is still set up.

## Quick Setup
```bash
cd /Users/johan/Documents/evolve-agent1
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b fix/validate-examples
```

## Your Mission
Make sure EVERY example works perfectly with the new 'Evolv' name. This is critical - broken examples will kill our launch!

## Why This Matters
- Examples are the first thing users try
- If they're broken, users lose trust immediately  
- You just did the rename, so you know what might have broken
- This blocks our PyPI release

## Key Tasks
1. Test every single example
2. Add time/cost estimates to each
3. Create a super quick demo example
4. Update the examples README

Read issue #62 for full details and comment there when you start!

This is the perfect follow-up to your rename work - making sure everything actually works!
