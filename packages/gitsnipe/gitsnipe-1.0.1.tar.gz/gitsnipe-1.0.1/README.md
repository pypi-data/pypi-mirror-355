- **Repository Cloning:**  
    Clone repositories using standard Git or [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) for maximum compatibility.
- **Automated Analysis:**  
    Analyze repository metadata, commit history, branches, tags, and structure.
- **Multi-format Input:**  
    Accepts TXT, CSV, and JSON files with domain/URL lists (with or without ports).
- **Detailed Reporting:**  
    Generates JSON and Markdown reports with scan and clone details.
- **Safe Credential Handling:**  
    Redacts sensitive tokens in saved reports and prompts before using high-privilege credentials.

## üì¶ Installation

```bash
pip install gitsnipe
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishanoshada/GitSnipe
cd GitSnipe
pip install -e .
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- [git-dumper](https://github.com/arthaud/git-dumper) (`pip install git-dumper`)
- Git client installed and available in PATH

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Scan

```bash
gitsnipe https://example.com
```

### Batch Scan

```bash
gitsnipe -i domain_ports.txt
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
gitsnipe [URL] [-i INPUT_FILE] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-f] [--clone]
```

#### Arguments

- `url`: Website URL to scan (e.g., `https://example.com`)
- `-i, --input-file`: File containing URLs/domains to scan (`.txt`, `.csv`, `.json`)
- `-o, --output-dir`: Directory for scan results and cloned repositories
- `-f, --force`: Overwrite existing clone directories
- `--clone`: Skip scanning and attempt direct cloning (useful if you already know the repo is exposed)

#### Examples

```bash
# Scan a single URL
gitsnipe https://example.com

# Scan multiple URLs from a file
gitsnipe -i domain_ports.txt -o output_dir

# Force overwrite existing directories during clone
gitsnipe https://example.com -f --clone

# Save results to a custom output directory
gitsnipe https://example.com -o /path/to/output
```
