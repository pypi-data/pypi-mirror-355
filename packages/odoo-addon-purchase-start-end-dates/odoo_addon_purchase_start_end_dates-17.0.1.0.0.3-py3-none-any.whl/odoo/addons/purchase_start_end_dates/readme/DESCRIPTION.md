This module adds the fields *Start Date* and *End Date* on purchase order
lines (requied fields when the product has the *Must Have Start and End
Dates* property). You can also define a *Default Start Date* and
*Default End Date* on the purchase order; when set, these dates will be used
by default on new purchase order lines. Upon invoice creation, the values of
the start/end dates of the purchase order line are copied to the start/end
dates of invoice lines.
