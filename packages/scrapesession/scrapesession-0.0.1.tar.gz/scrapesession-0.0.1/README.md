## Raison D'être :thought_balloon:

`scrapesession` is a requests session that performs heavy caching and other tools in order to efficiently scrape sites.

## Architecture :triangular_ruler:

`scrapesession` is a requests session that has the following properties:

1. Handle non 302 redirects (such as in javascript).
2. Retries and backoffs.
3. User-Agent rotations.
4. Caching.
5. Wayback Machine integration.

## Installation :inbox_tray:

This is a python package hosted on pypi, so to install simply run the following command:

`pip install scrapesession`

or install using this local repository:

`python setup.py install --old-and-unmanageable`

## Usage example :eyes:

The use of `scrapesession` is entirely through code due to it being a library. It has exactly the same semantics as a requests session:

```python
from scrapesession.scrapesession import create_scrape_session


session = create_scrape_session()

response = session.get("http://www.helloworld.com")
print(response.text)
```
