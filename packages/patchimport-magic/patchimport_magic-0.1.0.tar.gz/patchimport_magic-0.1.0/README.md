# patchimport-magic

IPython magic to patch modules before you import them.

`patchimport-magic` provides a cell magic (`%%patchimport`) that allows you to apply quick, in-memory patches to any installed Python module directly from a Jupyter Notebook or IPython session. This is incredibly useful for rapid debugging, performance profiling, experimenting with library internals without forking, or testing a potential fix on the fly.

## ü§î Why?

Have you ever wanted to:

- **Quickly A/B test a function's performance** with `%%timeit`?
- **Add a `print` statement** inside a third-party library function to see what's going on?
- **Test a one-line fix** for a bug without cloning and reinstalling the entire package?
- **Experiment with a function's behavior** by temporarily changing its source code?

`patchimport-magic` lets you do all of this and more, right from your notebook.

---

## üöÄ Installation

Install the package from PyPI:

```bash
pip install patchimport-magic
```

---

## ‚úçÔ∏è Usage

First, load the extension in your IPython or Jupyter environment.

```python
%load_ext patchimport
```

The magic command has two main forms:

1.  **Inserting Code**: `%%patchimport <module_name> <start_line>`
2.  **Replacing Code**: `%%patchimport <module_name> <start_line> <end_line>`

After running the magic cell, you **must import the module in a new cell** for the changes to take effect.

### Example 1: Inserting Code

Let's add a `print` statement to the standard library's `abc.py` module. We can insert a new attribute right before the class definition (around line 99).

```python
# %%
%%patchimport abc 99
# This line will be inserted before line 99 of the original abc.py
data = 'SURPRISE!!!'

# %%
# Now, import the patched module and access the new data
import abc

print(abc.data)
```

### Example 2: Replacing Code

Let's modify the behavior of `random.choice()`. We can patch it to always return the _first_ element of a sequence by replacing its original implementation.

```python
# %%
# Replace lines 378 through 378 (i.e., just line 378 in random.py)
%%patchimport random 378 379
        return seq[0] # Always return the first element!

# %%
import random

my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
print(f"Patched random.choice: {random.choice(my_list)}")
```

### Example 3: A/B Performance Testing with `%%timeit`

This is where `patchimport-magic` really shines. Imagine you have written a utility module and suspect one of its functions is slow. You can quickly test an alternative implementation without changing the file.

**Scenario:** Let's say you have this file, `my_utility_module.py`:

```python
# my_utility_module.py
def find_common_elements(list1, list2):
    """Finds common elements using a slow, nested loop approach."""
    common = []
    for item in list1:
        if item in list2: # O(n) lookup for lists is slow!
            common.append(item)
    return common
```

Now, in your notebook, first time the original, slow version.

```python
# In your Notebook:

# 1. Create some data
import my_utility_module

data = list(range(1000))
sample_to_find = list(range(500, 1500))

# 2. Time the original implementation
print("Timing original (list-based) implementation:")
%timeit my_utility_module.find_common_elements(data, sample_to_find)
```

You hypothesize that converting `list2` to a `set` for O(1) lookups will be much faster. Let's patch it and find out\!

```python
# 3. Patch the function with a faster implementation
# We will replace the body of the function (lines 3 to 7)
# Note: The end line in the magic (8) is exclusive.
%%patchimport my_utility_module 3 8
    # A much faster implementation using a set for O(1) lookups.
    set2 = set(list2)
    return [item for item in list1 if item in set2]

# 4. Re-import and time the new version
import my_utility_module # This re-import loads the patched version

print("\nTiming patched (set-based) implementation:")
%timeit my_utility_module.find_common_elements(data, sample_to_find)
```

**Expected Output:**

You will see a dramatic performance improvement, proving your hypothesis in seconds.

```
Timing original (list-based) implementation:
11.5 ms ¬± 123 ¬µs per loop (mean ¬± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100 loops each)

Patch applied from line 3 to 8:
...

REMEMBER TO DO `import my_utility_module` OR `from my_utility_module import ...` AFTER THIS MAGIC CALL!

Timing patched (set-based) implementation:
33.1 ¬µs ¬± 0.2 ¬µs per loop (mean ¬± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000 loops each)
```

This workflow allows for incredibly fast, iterative performance tuning without ever leaving your notebook.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

This magic uses Python's `importlib` library. It locates the source file for the specified module, reads its content, and applies the patch from your cell to the source code string in memory. Then, it compiles this new, modified source code and replaces the original module object in `sys.modules`. When you call `import` in the next cell, you get the patched version.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- **In-Memory Only**: Patches are not saved to disk and last only for the current kernel session.
- **Indentation**: You must provide the correct indentation for your patch code. There is no auto-indentation.
- **`??` Operator**: Using `??` in IPython/Jupyter to view a patched object's source may show the original, unpatched code.
- **Development Use**: This tool is designed for interactive debugging and experimentation, not for use in production code.
