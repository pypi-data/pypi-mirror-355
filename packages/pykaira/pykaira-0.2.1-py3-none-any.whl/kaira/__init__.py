"""Kaira is an open-source simulation toolkit for wireless communications built on PyTorch.

It provides a modular, user-friendly platform for developing, testing, and benchmarking advanced
communications algorithmsâ€”including deep learning-based approaches such as deep joint source-
channel coding (DeepJSCC). Designed to accelerate research and innovation, Kaira integrates
seamlessly with existing PyTorch projects, supporting rapid prototyping of novel communication
strategies.
