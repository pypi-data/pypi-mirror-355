"""Wagner soft-decision decoder for single parity-check codes.

This module implements the Wagner algorithm for soft-decision decoding of single parity-check
codes. The algorithm efficiently decodes single parity-check codes by making decisions based on the
reliability of received soft values, providing optimal performance in AWGN channels.

The Wagner algorithm is a classic technique for soft-decision decoding of single parity-check codes.
It leverages reliability information from the channel to make optimal decisions, providing
significant performance gains over hard-decision decoding approaches. This algorithm is especially
valuable in applications involving concatenated codes where single parity-check codes serve as
component codes.

    """Wagner soft-decision decoder for single parity-check codes.

    This decoder implements the Wagner algorithm :cite:`wagner1986simple`, which is designed
    specifically for single parity-check codes with soft-decision inputs. It leverages
    reliability information to make optimal decoding decisions under the assumption of an
    AWGN channel.

    The Wagner algorithm works by:
    1. Making initial hard decisions based on the sign of the received soft values
    2. Checking if the parity constraint is satisfied by these decisions
    3. If not, flipping the bit with the smallest absolute value (least reliable bit)

    This simple but elegant approach achieves optimal maximum likelihood decoding for
    single parity-check codes with soft inputs :cite:`moon2005error,hagenauer1989iterative`.
