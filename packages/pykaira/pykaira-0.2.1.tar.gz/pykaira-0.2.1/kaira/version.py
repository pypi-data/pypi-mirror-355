Kaira: A Toolbox for Simulating Communication Systems
================================================================

Kaira is an open-source simulation toolkit for communications research built on PyTorch. It provides a modular, user-friendly platform for developing, testing, and benchmarking advanced communications algorithmsâ€”including deep learning-based approaches such as deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC). Designed to accelerate research and innovation, Kaira integrates seamlessly with existing PyTorch projects, supporting rapid prototyping of novel communication strategies. License: MIT

Versioning
----------
This module uses a PEP 440 compliant versioning scheme.

Generic release markers:
    - Major.Minor       (e.g., "1.2")
    - Major.Minor.Patch (e.g., "1.2.3") for bugfix releases

Pre-release markers:
    - Alpha:    Major.Minor aN (e.g., "1.2a1")
    - Beta:     Major.Minor bN (e.g., "1.2b1")
    - RC:       Major.Minor rcN (e.g., "1.2rc1")

Development markers:
    - Dev:      Major.Minor.dev or Major.Minor.devN (where N is an integer; canonical form is "X.Y.dev0")

For example:
    "0.1.0", "2.0rc1", "2.1.dev0", etc.
