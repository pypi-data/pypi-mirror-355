To use this module you need to:

1.  Create a sales order.
2.  Set the above sales order type.
3.  Do a partial delivery.

Although it is possible to create an invoice from the order itself, the
‘Create invoice’ button will remain white and the order will not appear
in the list of orders to be invoiced, which can be consulted from the
‘To invoice’ menu.
