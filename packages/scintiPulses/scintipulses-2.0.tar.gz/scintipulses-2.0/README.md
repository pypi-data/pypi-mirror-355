**Simulate scintillation detector signals with photodetector effects, noise sources, and digitization modeling.**

`scintiPulses` is a Python package designed to generate realistic photodetector signals from scintillation detectors by modeling the entire signal chain‚Äîfrom energy deposition to digitized output. It incorporates key photochemical processes (scintillation light emission, photodetector response), electronic effects (amplification, noise, shaping), and digitization artifacts (sampling, quantization).

The package is compatible with Monte Carlo simulation frameworks (e.g., Geant4, MCNP, FLUKA), accepting deposited energy and timestamp data to produce high-fidelity pulse waveforms.
