# ArcGIS Pro Python Code Generation Testing Plan

## 1. Test Case Categories

### A. Vector Operations
- **Selection**: Select features based on attribute criteria or spatial relationships.
- **Buffering**: Generate buffers around features.
- **Intersection**: Identify overlapping areas between two layers.
- **Union**: Merge two layers to create a new layer containing all features from both.
- **Symmetrical Difference**: Identify non-overlapping areas between layers.

### B. Raster Operations
- **Clipping**: Clip a raster dataset to a specified boundary.
- **Reprojection**: Change the coordinate system of raster data.
- **Zonal Statistics**: Calculate statistics for raster values within defined zones.
- **Terrain Analysis**: Generate slope, aspect, hillshade, and ruggedness index.

### C. Geometric Calculations
- **Length and Area Calculation**: Measure lengths of polylines and areas of polygons.
- **Centroid Calculation**: Identify the central point of polygons.

### D. Data Conversion
- **CSV to Shapefile**: Convert tabular data to spatial data.
- **Raster to Vector**: Convert raster datasets to vector formats.
- **Vector to Raster**: Convert vector datasets to raster formats.

### E. Data Management
- **Attribute Management**: Add, modify, and delete attribute fields.
- **Join Operations**: Join attribute tables to spatial layers.
- **Export Operations**: Export results to various formats, including HTML reports and spreadsheets.

## 2. Dataset Requirements

| Test Case ID | Dataset Name            | Description                            | Format   |
|--------------|-------------------------|----------------------------------------|----------|
| TC001        | US_Counties.shp         | Shapefile containing US county boundaries | Shapefile |
| TC002        | PA_DEM.tif              | Digital Elevation Model for Pennsylvania | GeoTIFF  |
| TC003        | Fastfood_Locations.csv  | CSV file with latitude and longitude of fast-food locations | CSV       |
| TC004        | Roads.shp               | Road network shapefile                 | Shapefile |

## 3. Expected Code Outputs

### Example Test Case: TC001 - Select counties with less than 10% population growth
**Objective**: Identify counties with a population growth rate below 10% between 2005 and 2008.

**Generated Code**:
```python
import arcpy

# Set the workspace
arcpy.env.workspace = "C:/GIS/Projects"

# Input feature class
input_fc = "US_Counties.shp"

# Output feature class
output_fc = "Selected_Counties.shp"

# SQL query
query = "Population_Growth < 10"

# Select features by attribute
arcpy.management.SelectLayerByAttribute(input_fc, "NEW_SELECTION", query)

# Save the selected features
arcpy.management.CopyFeatures(input_fc, output_fc)
```

**Expected Output**: A shapefile containing counties meeting the criteria.

## 4. Automation Status

| Test Case ID | Fully Automated | Manual Steps Required | Notes                  |
|--------------|-----------------|-----------------------|------------------------|
| TC001        | Yes             | No                    | -                      |
| TC002        | Yes             | No                    | Ensure dataset is preloaded |
| TC003        | No              | Yes                   | Requires manual input of parameters |
| TC004        | Yes             | No                    | -                      |

## 5. Failure Points and Debugging Tips
- **Common Pitfalls**: 
  - Incorrect file paths: Ensure all datasets are correctly referenced.
  - Missing fields: Verify that attribute fields referenced in the query exist in the dataset.
  - Projection issues: Ensure datasets are in the same coordinate system.

- **Debugging Tips**:
  - Use `arcpy.GetMessages()` to retrieve error messages from ArcPy operations.
  - Validate SQL queries by testing them directly in ArcGIS Pro before scripting.
  - Check the integrity of input datasets using `arcpy.Describe()`.
