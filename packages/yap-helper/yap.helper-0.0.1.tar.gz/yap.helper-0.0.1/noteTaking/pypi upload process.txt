type into command prompt: 
"pip3 install setuptools twine"

then navigate to the path of the yap.helper:

yap.helper's path = C:\Users\graham.lasseigne\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python311\yap.helper

once you have navigated to it you can type in "ls" (that's an L then an S)
    you'll be able to see the directory

we now must create a distruptable version of our library

now in the same directory, type: 
"python3 setup.py sdist" then enter

that does everything we need. 

and if you retype in the "ls" after you have run the sdist in command prompt 
    you can now see a dist file appear in the directory

to upload it to pypi, we need to use a tool named twine 

then type in this: "twine upload --repository-url https://upload.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*"

it will ask your username and password
username: "yap.athy" 
password: idk

then it is on there, good job
