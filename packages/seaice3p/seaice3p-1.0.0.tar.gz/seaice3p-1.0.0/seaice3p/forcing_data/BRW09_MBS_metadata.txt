-----------------------------------------------------

In 2009, the site was about 1000 meters offshore of Niksuiraq, 
  the hook at the end of the road out to Pt. Barrow. 
The site was installed by Chris Petirch, Matthew Druckenmiller, 
  and Jeremy Harbeck. 
GPS location of data logger: 71.36655 deg N, 156.54140 deg W

The following measurements are recorded: 
(i) snow depth, ice thickness, and local water depth;
(ii) temperature profile through air-snow-ice-water; 
(iii) air temperature and relative humidity approx. 2m above the ice.

The mass balance site was installed 15 January 2009 with one snow 
  depth pinger mounted at temperature/humidity mast above the 
  upward looking altimeter.
  (Campbell SR50, address 0; replaced on 24 January with Campbell 
   SR50, address 2. The new instrument started to deliver data at 
   13:45 AKST.)
Thermistor string, data logger box w/antenna, and mass balance mast 
  are collinear with approx. 5 m separation between each.
On March 28, an additional snow pinger SR50A was added (ID=0).

Another additional snow pinger (Campbell SR50a) was expected to be deployed 
  but was never deployed.

The thermistor string was removed on 12 June 2009 (the ice was completely
  melted around the string since at least 9 June); the remaining sensors
  were recovered on 13 June 2009 by Chris Petrich and Josh Jones.

  internet connection. Communication with Campbell LoggerNet 3.5.1


-----------------------------------------------------

Measurement intervals:

The measurement interval was 15 minutes. Values reported are
  instantaneous, non-averaged measurements.

The data logger clock was set to Alaska Standard Time (UTC-9). 
  However, times reported below are converted to UTC.


-----------------------------------------------------

Notes:

(i)     All depths are referenced to the ice/water interface at the 
          time of installation.

(ii)    T107 water temp is used by the data logger program to 
          correct the underwater depths delivered by sounders using 
          an equation for the speed of sound as function of 
          temperature. The T107 temperature is read, an offset of 
          +0.45 C is applied, and the speed of sound is calculated.
        This is bogus. The calculated temperature is in the range 
          of -1.5 C, while it should be -1.9+-0.1 C.
          TODO: correct data logger program. Expected error in ice
          thickness and water depth measurement: < 5 mm.
        The temperature reported in this data file (column 7) is 
          back-corrected by applying an offset of -0.45 C.

(iii)   Similarly, the snow pinger uses a correction from the air 
          temperature measurement of the CS500. No temperature offset 
          is added.
          (The operating temperature of the CS500 is down to -40C. 
          The lowest reading returned by the temperature sensor is
          –39.66 C. The sensor does not return a special code for
          "out of range".)

(iv)    Day-of-year is the fractional day of the year with 
          midnight 1 January midnight being 1.0.

(v)     The reference resistor is a low-temperature co-efficient 
          resistor. It replaces the upper-most thermistor
          of the CRREL thermistor string. Its value is close to 
          the resistor in the voltage bridge.

(vi)    Data from the the relative humidity sensor are questionable.
          Sensor needs replacement.

Events (local time, Alaska):
03 June:         Pinger mast starts to slip vertically through 
                 the ice.
28 March:        Installed snow pinger SR50A with SID=0.
26 March:        Installed Aero4Gen wind turbine and charge 
                 controller, both connected in parallel to the 
                 batteries. First measurement on day 86, 
                 02:15 UTC reading about 14.5 V at 15 mph wind
                 and -23 C air temperature.
08 March:        Alaska changes to daylight savings time at
                 2 am Alaska Standard Time. This should not
                 affect the data file.
04 March:        Batteries replaced by BASC staff on day
                 64, 02:30 UTC. No measurements at day 
                 64, 02:30 UTC.
01 March:        Batteries recover enough for operation by 
                 themselves.
27 February:     Batteries drained: Starting day 58, 
                 09:30 UTC the battery voltage drops from 
                 11.20 V to 10.54 V at day 58, 18:45 UTC. 
                 The next measurement recorded is day 60, 
                 21:45 UTC at 11.66 V.
11 February:     11:30 AKST bear bends up snow pinger arm
                 (between 20:30 and 20:45 on day 42, UTC)
                 apparent distance between pinger and snow 
                 increases 96 mm. 
                 Data in the file have correction +0.096 m applied.
09--12 February: Air temperature may have fallen below -40 C.
08 February:     Battery change by BASC staff (data logger 
                 generates second entry with same time stamp)
24 January:      Replacement of SR50 snow pinger (ID=0) with 
                 another SR50 snow pinger (ID=2) by BASC staff
15 January:      Installation of air temperature/humidity 
                 probe and SR50 snow pinger (ID=0)
14 January:      Installation of thermistor string, data 
                 logger box, antenna, and underwater sounders


-----------------------------------------------------

Quality Comments:
The data have been processed to compute the physical values from 
  the measured quantities. Missing values or invalid data are 
  indicated as -9999.

Thermistor string temperature measurements:
(Note: the upper and middle sections are swapped with respect to 
  previous years.)
Two bad thermistors in string 3 (bottom), data masked by -9999.
The thermistor string is completely embedded in conduit painted 
  white. It is subject to solar radiative heating. Effects due 
  to thermal conductivity, and the effective response time are 
  unknown.
No calibration of thermistor strings.
  Thermistors in water have individual offsets of approximately 
  +/- 0.1 C.
The thermistor string was melted out, i.e. surrounded by water
  rather than ice, since 9 June.
Post-deployment inspection: protective coating was missing from 
  thermistor T18 (second to last in middle string). Protective 
  coating of thermistors T15 and T17 were lose or cracked. 
  (Sealed these flaws with PC-Marine hand moldable expoxy putty 
  for next year.)

Crude absolute calibration of T107 water sensor (offset -0.45 C 
  added).

Underwater sounders: 
Return values of "99" (indicating missing return signals) and values 
  indicating grossly wrong distances are flagged as -9999
Sounder measuring ice thickness shows periodically an increase in 
  path length by approx. 2 cm (this looks like noice with ice 
  thicknesses that are too thin). 
  These periods seem to be related to changes in the environment 
  and may indicate actual changes in the acoustical path length.
The pinger mast started to slip vertically on June 3. Hence, 
  measurements of snow depth (column 12), ice thickness (column 13) 
  and water depth (column 14) are systematically biased since 
  June 3 inclusive.
Note that water depth is referenced to the ice--water interface.
  Ice grew 0.7 m since deployment, equivalent to a change in
  freeboard of several centimeters. This needs to be accounted
  for.
Post-deployment inspection: sensor of upward-looking sounder was 
  coated by a thin film of algae; sensor of downward looking sounder 
  was free of algae. Water was a soup of brown/green algae in mid June.  

Snow pingers: 
The original SR50 pinger (ID=0; column 12) had problems, returning 
  "0" readings most of the time (indicated as -9999 in the data 
  file). The intermittend readings are considered good.
The snow pinger on the mast has an offset of +0.096 m applied 
  starting day 42, 20:45 UTC. This is to compensate for misalignment
  of the temperature/pinger arm after a bear visit.

Pingers (columns 10 to 12) have value set to -9999 when either not 
  connected (i.e. before they were installed), when no signal 
  detected (99 returned), or when distances measured were 
  obviously wrong (raw data <0.5 m or >5 m).

The pinger mast started to slip vertically on June 3. Hence, 
  measurements of snow depth (column 12), ice thickness (column 13) 
  and water depth (column 14) are systematically biased since 
  June 3 inclusive.

Snow depth/surface ablation determined by the pinger in column 10
  is considered reliable. Distance measurement of the pinger 
  agreed with tape measure to better than 0.01 m on 13 June.

Time:
Since I was not able to reliably determine a systematic drift of
  the data logger clock between mid Feb and mid June based on
  time stamps attached by the processing computers, the clock
  of the CR10X is probably accurate to better than 5 minutes 
  throughout the course of the field season.
