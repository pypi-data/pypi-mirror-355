## âœ¨ Features

* **Effortless Setup:** Configure comprehensive logging with a single function call.
* **Zero Unwanted Logs:** Implements `NullHandler` by default, ensuring your library doesn't spam user consoles unless explicitly configured.
* **Highly Configurable:** Control log levels, output destinations (console, file), log formats, and date formats with flexible parameters.
* **Intelligent File Handling:** Automatically resolves log file paths, creates necessary directories, and handles common file-related issues gracefully.
* **Idempotent Configuration:** Safely call `setup` multiple times without creating duplicate log handlers.
* **Dedicated Logger:** Provides a named logger (`github_activity`) isolated from the root logger, preventing interference with other application logging.
* **Robust Error Reporting:** Logs internal errors during logging setup itself (e.g., file writing issues) to ensure visibility.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Utilizes `pathlib` for robust and platform-independent file path management.
