[CDF-24989, CDF-24988] ðŸ˜… Group unfortunate diffs (#1635)

# Description

## Problem

The following group configuration two problems

1. The metadata values should be strings, but the yaml parser will parse
`true`, `0123`, and `.inf` as bool, `0123` as octal returning int `83`.
2. The `tableScope` is given as an empty dict. That will look like the
group has changed each time the user runs `cdf deploy` as Toolkit
expects `db_complete_org: []` and not `db_complete_org: {}`. Note that
this is a result of an unfortunate flexibility in a table scope that can
be defined either as an array or a mapping.

```yaml
name: gp_table_scoped_complete_org
sourceId: '1234567890123456789'
metadata:
  origin: cognite-toolkit
  governed: true
  groupNo: 0123
  maxUsers: .inf
  description: foo:bar
capabilities:
- rawAcl:
    actions:
    - READ
    - WRITE
    scope:
      tableScope:
        dbsToTables:
          db_complete_org: {}
```

## Solution 1 (discarded)

Part 1: Create a special YAML parser that reads values as strings. ->
This turned out to be non-trivial.

Part 2: Evaluate empty array to equal empty mapping {} -> This is
complex as we must either deal with arbitrary capability ordering, or
assume same order and compare the local definition to the CDF one.

## Solution 2 (implemented)

Instead we want to encourage the user to use the following standardized
format and fixing their poorly defined YAML

```yaml
name: gp_table_scoped_complete_org
sourceId: '1234567890123456789'
metadata:
  origin: cognite-toolkit
  governed: "true"
  groupNo: "0123"
  maxUsers: ".inf"
  description: foo:bar
capabilities:
- rawAcl:
    actions:
    - READ
    - WRITE
    scope:
      tableScope:
        dbsToTables:
          db_complete_org: []
```

We do this by improving the validation done in the `cdf build` command
informing the user to comply with the format above:

**Note** This means that Toolkit reduces the flexibility in `rawAcl`
tableScope to always use an array format. I consider this is a desirable
standardization.

## Changelog

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## cdf

### Fixed

- Standardization of the Group configuration format. This will help
avoid unchanged groups to be redeployed when running `cdf deploy`. The
old format is still allowed, but will produce a warning when running
`cdf build`.

## templates

No changes.
