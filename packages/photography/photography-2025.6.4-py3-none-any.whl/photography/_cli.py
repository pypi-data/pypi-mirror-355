"""
A tool for managing photography libraries.

To Do:

  * Move modes:
    - dry-run
    - interactive-confirm
    - symlink
    - really-move

  * Every duplicate-flagged photo better confirm that the "better" one really
    is being imported and not also trashed

  * Show statistics at the end of a run
    - file size
    - number of JPG vs RAW
    - number of videos
    - number of files with each resulting effect (in groups)

  * Build a persistent `imagehash` database
  * Strip leading `.` from hidden files we're trash-confirming
  * Write some manifest out on what files we moved where

  * Signal which files are safe to delete from the phone

  * Ignore `mtime`s before `EARLIEST_YEAR`?
