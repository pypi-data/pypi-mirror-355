# TrustCaptcha for Python — GDPR-compliant, privacy-first CAPTCHA

Protect websites and apps against bots and spam with a privacy-first, EU-hosted CAPTCHA solution.


## What is TrustCaptcha?

TrustCaptcha combines proof-of-work, an AI bot-score and custom security rules to stop automated bot abuse — without image marking or puzzles

Key perks:
- **Privacy-friendly & GDPR-compliant** – data processed exclusively in Europe
- **No visual challenges** – users never label images or solve quizzes
- **Fully themable widget** – matches any brand and design and improves your user flow
- **Conversion-safe** – near-zero user drop-off compared to legacy CAPTCHAs

Read the full [TrustCaptcha product overview](https://www.trustcomponent.com/en/products/captcha) for technical details and the security concept.


## Get started

2. **Choose a CAPTCHA:** pick an existing one or create a new one.
3. **Embed the widget:** implement the TrustCaptcha widget into your website or app.
4. **Validate result:** validate the CAPTCHA verification result in your backend.

Need a walkthrough? See the [Python integration guide](https://www.trustcomponent.com/en/products/captcha/integrations/python-captcha).


## Basic Python integration

1. Install the dependency
```bash
pip install trustcaptcha-python
```

2. Retrieve the verification result
```python
# Retrieving the verification result
try:
    verification_result = CaptchaManager.get_verification_result("<your_secret_key>", "<verification_token_from_your_client>")
except Exception as e:
    # Fetch verification result failed - handle error
    print(f"Failed to fetch verification result: {e}")
    return jsonify({'error': 'Captcha verification failed'}), 500

```

3. Act on the result
```python
# Do something with the verification result
if verification_result.verificationPassed is not True or verification_result.score > 0.5:
    print("Verification failed, or bot score is higher than 0.5 – this could indicate a bot.")

```

Congratulations — you have successfully validated the result of the CAPTCHA!
