This module extends the functionality of survey to support customization
of certification reports. Specifically, it enables:

- Overriding the company name displayed on the certificate.
- Setting a custom logo for each certification.

By default, Odoo pulls this information from the company settings, but
this addon makes it editable at the survey level. It’s designed with
minimal scope for easier integration and maintenance.
