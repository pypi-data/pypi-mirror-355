This module extends the functionality of survey to support customization of certification reports. Specifically, it enables:

- Overriding the company name displayed on the certificate.
- Setting a custom logo for each certification.

By default, Odoo pulls this information from the company settings, but this addon makes it editable at the survey level. Itâ€™s designed with minimal scope for easier integration and maintenance.
