"""
Formerly a collection of context managers, but currently only the one.
Most of the former context managers that could have been here are now part of the stdlib.
For example, a long time ago, there was a "AbstractContextManager" definition in this file.

    Used in the main thread to receive a KeyboardInterrupt, but do nothing until the context ends.

    Note that if you're using this, you should probably be running the script through `Click` (or similar) instead, or this should be in your `__name__=="__main__":` handler.

    Due to how signals in python work, this can only be used in the main thread. The original use of this was to allow a handler to properly clean up some download threads.

    Can (and probably should) be subclassed to give the `__exit__` method(s) any additional functionality to clean up resources.
    If you choose to do that, call `super().__exit__(typ, val, tb)` last so that your handler correctly handles the received signal.
