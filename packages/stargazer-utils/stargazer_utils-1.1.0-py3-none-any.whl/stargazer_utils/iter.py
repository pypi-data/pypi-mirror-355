    `batched` was introduced in Python 3.12,

    If the 3.12+ ver is available, you should probably prefer that.
    That said, this version will work in all versions of python 3 where `itertools.islice` is available.

def flatten(iterable: typing.Iterable[T]) -> typing.Iterator[T]:
    """
    Based on [moreitertools.collapse](https://more-itertools.readthedocs.io/en/stable/_modules/more_itertools/more.html#collapse)

    Flattens nested iterables to a single iterable. Sometimes called `hard_flatten`.

        >>> list(flatten([[1,2,3], [4,5,6]]))
        [1,2,3,4,5,6]

    Differences from moreitertools.collapse:

    This version ***removes***, and does ***not*** support:
    - The usage of a deque. The import and usage seemed unnecessary, since the original recipe always pops and appends to the left side.
    - The ability to specifiy types that shouldn't be flattened. The only types that avoid being flattened in this one are `str` and `bytes`, and this is explicitly because those types being flattened is actively harmful in almost all cases.
    - The notion of flattening to a specific level of flatness. I consider this a weird usecase and I don't want to support it. Don't be weird: Just flatten your iterables all the way down.
