Utility functions without better homes.

Contains iterators, object utility functions, and testing utilities.

Most of these deserve better homes.

    Helper function that takes an object and creates a dictionary of the specified fields of that object.

    ```python
    class Foo():
        bar = 1
        baz = True

    ```

    If prefaced with `assert`, Python will strip it out of your code out of `__debug__`, which may or may not be what you want.

    If you do preface an `invariant()` call with `assert`, note that the `InvariantViolation` will happen first,
    and you will not see an `AssertionError`.

    Note that typecheckers tend to hate the way that I've defined this. You likely will run into type-checker errors.
