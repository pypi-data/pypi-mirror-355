"""
Contains the `Timer` class, which can be used to measure time to roughly 3 decimal digits of precision.
```python
t = Timer()
with t:
    time.sleep(1)
# t.duration available here.
```
Note that this is **not good enough** to do any serious performance testing. It *will* give you a good idea of the timing in file manipulation.

Timer also contains some utility methods for timestamps.
- Timer.utcnow() -> datetime:
- Timer.get_utc() -> int:
- Timer.get_utc_string() -> str:

class Timer(AbstractContextManager):
    """
    Timer object used for timing things where extremely high resolution time data doesn't matter.

    If you need sub-millisecond resolution, **this is not an appropriate class**.

    ### As object
    Timer can be used as an object, e.g.:
    ```python
    t = Timer()
    t.start()
    # Some code
    t.stop() # time now available with t.duration
    ```
    Timer objects can be started as soon as they're made like this:
    ```python
    t = Timer(start_now=True)
    ```

    ### As Context Manager
    Timer can be used as a context manager. This is likely the preferred way to use a Timer.
    ```python
    t = Timer()
    with t:
        pass # something you would want to time.
    # t.duration available here.
    ```
    Note that the t instance ***automatically*** starts when entered and stops when exited.

    ### Timing a series.
    Timer can be used to time a series of timestamps.

    Every call to Timer.lap() on a Timer instance will
    add the current time to it's time stamps.

    Starting a timer will start a lap, and stopping the timer
    will end the current lap.

    To put it another way: `t.start(); t.stop` will
    result in the t object having 1 lap in total saved.
    ```python
    t = Timer(start_now=True)
    t.stop()
    # These two lines are the same total duration.
    t.duration
    t.time_stamps[-1] - t.time_stamps[0]

    t.start()
    t.lap()
    t.lap()
    t.stop()
    t.get_laps() # generates 3 laps.
    ```
