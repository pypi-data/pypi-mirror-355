# text_console

A customizable Tkinter-based text console widget with support for command history and interactive execution, in which a user types in commands to be sent to the Python interpreter.

It includes options for overriding specific variables through subclassing, by extending the `TextConsole` class.

The package is installable via pip.

## Features

- Tkinter-based package.
- Full multi-line commands support.
- Customizable history file.
- Context menu with options for Cut, Copy, Paste, and Clear.
- Extendable for additional functionality.

The package provides flexibility to customize:

- `history_file`: Change the location of the history file
- `console_locals`: Add custom variables and functions to the console's namespace
- `context_menu_items`: Modify the right-click context menu
- `show_about_message`: Customize the about dialog content
- `show_help_content`: Customize the help window content
