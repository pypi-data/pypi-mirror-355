# Omega-Prime-Visibility

This packages uses [VisiLibity1](https://karlobermeyer.github.io/VisiLibity1/) through [visilibity](https://pypi.org/project/VisiLibity/) (LGPL) to comptue the visibility of MovingObjects of [omega-prime](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega-prime)-Recordings. For every object it computes the visibilty as a float (`1.0` for fully visible and `0.0` for not visible) (assuming 2D-brids-eye-view geometries) from the point of view of one object (assumed as a point in the center of the object). In addition the objects occluding the view (occluders) are computed.

This package also provides the computation of visibility as an omega-prime [Metric](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega-prime/blob/main/tutorial_metrics.ipynb): `from omega_prime_visibility import visibility`.

The example file [highway_merge.mcap](./highway_merge.mcap) is taken from [omega-prime](https://github.com/ika-rwth-aachen/omega-prime) and derived from [esmini](https://github.com/esmini/esmini) and is under MPL-2.0 license.

## License
This python package is distributed under MIT license but the linked libraries [visilibity](https://pypi.org/project/VisiLibity/) and [VisiLibity1](https://karlobermeyer.github.io/VisiLibity1/) are under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL).

## Requirements
You need to have installed `swig`, `boost` and `cython` to be able to install [visilibity](https://pypi.org/project/VisiLibity/)

On windows you need to additonally install Buildtools:
1. Download [Buildtools fÃ¼r Visual Studio 2022](https://aka.ms/vs/17/release/vs_BuildTools.exe)
2. Select `C++ Tools for Linux Development` and install

## Installation
`pip install omega-prime-visibility`

## Usage
See [./tutorial.ipynb](./tutorial.ipynb) for detailed instructions.


```python
from omega_prime_visibility import get_visibility_df
import omega_prime
import shapely

r = omega_prime.Recording.from_file('highway_merge.mcap', compute_polygons=True)

obstruction_poly = shapely.Polygon([
    [-220,10],
    [-120,10],
    [-120,-0],
    [-220,-0],
])
df = get_visibility_df(r._df, ego_idx=0, static_occluder_polys=[obstruction_poly])
```

returns
