# aws-glue-availability

[AWS Glue](https://aws.amazon.com/glue) provides disaster / recovery through Glue ETL retry mechanism testing for the successful connector starting with the first referenced working to the last incrementally until it finds a successful connection. To ensure a certain level of high availability (all be it not in the strictest of senses) multiple connectors need to be associated across different [Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/).

This tool is to aid in viewing the placement of Glue Jobs through their associated Connectors Subnet information, to provide a visual aid in understanding the distribution of Glue jobs across the VPCs / Subnets within your platform.

## Running
