*A phylogenetic tree builder for DNA sequence analysis using parsimony and maximum likelihood methods.*

**Why it matters:**  
- 🔍 **Parsimony** finds the simplest tree with the fewest evolutionary changes—lightning-fast and perfect for classroom demos or sketching out relationships in agricultural genetics.  
- 🧮 **Maximum Likelihood** applies explicit statistical models of sequence evolution to infer the tree that best explains your data—essential for robust analyses in real-world forensics or crop-breeding studies.  
- ⚖️ **Compare both** to gauge confidence, uncover hidden rate variation, and get a fuller picture of evolutionary history.  

  Whether you’re teaching high school biology or delving into forensic DNA casework, SimplePhylo empowers you to explore and explain phylogenies with clarity and rigor.

## 🧐 Overview  
**SimplePhylo** (a.k.a. Evolutionary Tree Analyzer) is a cute, flash‑fast Python package and Dash web app for building phylogenetic trees from FASTA sequences.

It enables you to:
- Parse DNA sequences in **FASTA** format.  
- Align them using **MUSCLE v3.8.31**.  
- Build phylogenetic trees via both **Parsimony** (UPGMA) and **ML-style** (distance-based on identity).  
- Visualize and export tree images as `.png` for teaching slides, lab reports, or research.  

Whether you’re running a quick classroom demo or prototyping a research pipeline, SimplePhylo keeps everything modular and accessible.

## ⚙️ MUSCLE Alignment Notes

This project uses [MUSCLE](https://drive5.com/muscle/downloads_v3.htm) v3.8.31 to align DNA sequences.

- For small files, alignment runs automatically in Python
- For large files, use the batch script: align_manual.bat

#### You must have `MUSCLE` installed and accessible from your system's PATH for alignment.
💡 Ensure the muscle.exe binary is placed in:
C:\Program Files\muscle\muscle.exe
Or edit the .bat file to reflect the correct path.

MUSCLE citation:

✨Please cite this work if you use the alignment functionality in your research or publications.

 🧠 Tips for Large Input Files

- **Work smaller first**: debug your pipeline on 5–10 sequences before scaling up.  
- **Split & conquer**: break multi-FASTA into chunks (`seqkit split2` or `bash` loops).  
- **Memory guardrails**: MUSCLE can spike RAM on huge alignments—keep input FASTA under 50 MB.  
- **Use the batch script** (`align_manual.bat` or your own shell wrapper) for > 1000 sequences.

## 🧪 Example Workflow
1. Drop your .fasta file into the data/ folder
2. Launch the app or notebook
3. You’ll get:
  - A multiple sequence alignment (FASTA)
  - Two phylogenetic trees (Parsimony & ML-style)
  - PNG files saved in output/tree_images/

Perfect for:
🧬 Biology class demonstrations
🧪 Research prototyping
📚 Curriculum development
💡 Student-led investigations

## 🧰 Future Plans
  
- [ ] Add support for bootstrap analysis  
- [ ] Export PDF/HTML reports  
- [ ] Add tree comparison metrics (e.g., RF distance)
