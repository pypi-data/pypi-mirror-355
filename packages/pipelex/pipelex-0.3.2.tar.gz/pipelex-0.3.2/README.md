# Introduction

Pipelex makes it easy for developers to define and run repeatable AI workflows. At its core is a clear, declarative pipeline language specifically crafted for knowledge-processing tasks.

Build **pipelines** from modular pipes that snap together. Each pipe can use a different language model (LLM) or software to process knowledge. Pipes consistently deliver **structured, predictable outputs** at each stage.

Pipelex uses TOML syntax, making workflows readable and shareable. Business professionals, developers, and AI coding agents can all understand and modify the same pipeline definitions.

Example:
```toml
[concept]
Buyer = "The person who made the purchase"
PurchaseDocumentText = "Transcript of a receipt, invoice, or order confirmation"

[pipe.extract_buyer]
PipeLLM = "Extract buyer from purchase document"
inputs = { purchase_document_text = "PurchaseDocumentText" }
output = "Buyer"
llm = "llm_to_extract_info"
prompt_template = """
Extract the first and last name of the buyer from this purchase document:
@purchase_document_text
"""
```

Pipes are modular building blocks that **connect sequentially, run in parallel, or call sub-pipes.** Like function calls in traditional programming, but with a clear contract: knowledge-in, knowledge-out. This modularity makes pipelines perfect for sharing: fork someone's invoice processor, adapt it for receipts, share it back. 

Pipelex is an **open-source Python library** with a hosted API launching soon. It integrates seamlessly into existing systems and automation frameworks. Plus, it works as an [MCP server](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-mcp) so AI agents can use pipelines as tools.

# 🚀 Quick start

> :books: Note that you can check out the [Pipelex Documentation](doc/Documentation.md) for more information and clone the [Pipelex Cookbook](https://github.com/Pipelex/pipelex-cookbook) repository for ready-to-run samples.

Follow these steps to get started:

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python ≥3.10
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/), [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), or [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Install the package

```bash
# Using pip
pip install pipelex

# Using Poetry
poetry add pipelex

# Using uv (Recommended)
uv pip install pipelex
```

## IDE extension

We **highly** recommend installing an extension for TOML files into your IDE of choice. For VS Code, the [Even Better TOML](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tamasfe.even-better-toml) extension does a great job of syntax coloring and checking.

### Optional Features

The package supports the following additional features:

- `anthropic`: Anthropic/Claude support
- `google`: Google models (Vertex) support
- `mistralai`: Mistral AI support
- `bedrock`: AWS Bedrock support
- `fal`: Image generation with Black Forest Labs "FAL" service

Install all extras:

Using `pip`:
```bash
pip install "pipelex[anthropic,google,mistralai,bedrock,fal]"
```

Using `poetry`:
```bash
poetry add "pipelex[anthropic,google,mistralai,bedrock,fal]"
```

Using `uv`:
```bash
uv pip install "pipelex[anthropic,google,mistralai,bedrock,fal]"
```
