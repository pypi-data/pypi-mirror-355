# Claude Command Examples

## Real-Time Three-Way Conversations

The core feature is live collaboration between Claude, AI models, and you:

```bash
# Start a conversation
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "Hi AI! Let's discuss the best approach for building a REST API"

# Watch responses stream live in another terminal
tail -f ~/.claude-mcp-servers/claude-command/conversations/live_stream.txt

# Continue the conversation
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "The AI suggested FastAPI. What do you think about authentication patterns?"

# View complete conversation history
mcp__claude-command__get_conversation_history
```

## Session-Based Conversations

Each Claude Code session maintains one continuous conversation:

```bash
# First message
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "I'm building a chat app. What database should I use?"

# Later in same session - AI remembers the context
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "How would you handle real-time messaging with that database?"

# Even later - full context maintained
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "What about scaling to 10k concurrent users?"
```

## Code Review Collaboration

Get a second AI opinion on your code:

```bash
# Claude writes code for you
> Write a user authentication function

# Get AI's review
mcp__claude-command__ai_review
code: |
  def authenticate_user(email, password):
      user = User.query.filter_by(email=email).first()
      if user and user.check_password(password):
          return user
      return None
focus: "security"

# Continue discussion with both AIs about improvements
```

## Brainstorming Sessions

Collaborative idea generation:

```bash
mcp__claude-command__ai_brainstorm
topic: "Reducing API response times"
context: "Currently averaging 500ms, need to get under 100ms"

# Follow up with specific questions
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "The AI mentioned caching. What specific caching strategy would work best for user data that changes frequently?"
```

## Problem-Solving Workflow

1. **Present problem to both AIs**
2. **Get different perspectives**
3. **Compare approaches**
4. **Iterate on solutions**

```bash
# Start with Claude
> How should I structure a microservices architecture?

# Get AI's take
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "Claude suggested event-driven architecture. What are the trade-offs vs REST APIs for microservices?"

# Compare and decide
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "Based on both approaches, what would you recommend for a team of 5 developers building an e-commerce platform?"
```

## Temperature Control

Adjust creativity vs consistency:

```bash
# Factual, precise responses
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "Explain SQL indexing best practices"
temperature: 0.2

# Creative, exploratory responses
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "What are some unconventional ways to improve developer productivity?"
temperature: 0.8
```

## Live Streaming Setup

Watch conversations happen in real-time:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Run Claude Code
claude

# Terminal 2: Watch live conversation stream
tail -f ~/.claude-mcp-servers/claude-command/conversations/live_stream.txt

# Terminal 1: Start conversation - Terminal 2 shows live responses
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "Let's debug this performance issue together..."
```

## Advanced: Multi-Turn Technical Discussions

```bash
# Architecture discussion
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "I need to design a system that processes 1M events per second. What architecture would you recommend?"

# Deep dive into specifics
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "You mentioned Kafka. How would you handle exactly-once processing guarantees?"

# Implementation details
mcp__claude-command__ai_query
prompt: "Can you walk through the producer/consumer code patterns for that setup?"

# Review complete discussion
mcp__claude-command__get_conversation_history
```

## Why This Works

- **Continuous context**: Each session builds one conversation thread
- **Real-time feedback**: See responses as they're generated
- **Multiple perspectives**: Compare different AI approaches
- **Natural flow**: Conversations feel like actual collaboration
- **Persistent memory**: Full history saved for reference

This creates genuine AI pair programming where you're actively collaborating with multiple AI minds in real-time.
