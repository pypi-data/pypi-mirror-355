Graphsignal is an inference observability platform that helps developers accelerate and troubleshoot AI systems. With Graphsignal, developers can:

* Identify and optimize the most significant contributors to latency.
* Ensure optimal inference performance and model configuration for hosted models.
* Track errors and monitor APIs, compute, and GPU utilization.
* Analyze model API costs for deployments, models, sessions, or any custom tags.

## Install

Install the Graphsignal library.

```bash
pip install --upgrade graphsignal
```


## Configure

Configure Graphsignal tracer by specifying your API key directly or via `GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY` environment variable.

```python
import graphsignal

graphsignal.configure(api_key='my-api-key')
# or pass the API key in GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY environment variable
```

See [`configure()`](https://graphsignal.com/docs/reference/python-api/#graphsignalconfigure) API docs for all configuration parameters.


To get an API key, sign up for a free account at [graphsignal.com](https://graphsignal.com). The key can then be found in your account's [Settings / API Keys](https://app.graphsignal.com/settings/api-keys) page.

Alternatively, you can add Graphsignal tracer from the command line, when running your module or script. Environment variables `GRAPHSIGNAL_API_KEY` and `GRAPHSIGNAL_DEPLOYMENT` must be set.

```bash
python -m graphsignal <script>
```

```bash
python -m graphsignal -m <module>
```


## Integrate

Graphsignal integrates through tracing - either via auto-instrumentation or manual setup. It automatically captures traces, errors, performance profiles, and data. All insights are available for analysis at [app.graphsignal.com](https://app.graphsignal.com/).

Refer to the guides below for detailed information on:

* [Manual Tracing](https://graphsignal.com/docs/guides/manual-tracing/)
* [Inference Profiling](https://graphsignal.com/docs/guides/infefence-profiling/)
* [Session Tracking](https://graphsignal.com/docs/guides/session-tracking/)
* [Cost and Usage Monitoring](https://graphsignal.com/docs/guides/cost-and-usage-monitoring/)

See [API reference](https://graphsignal.com/docs/reference/python-api/) for full documentation.

Integration examples are available in [examples](https://github.com/graphsignal/examples) repository.


## Analyze

[Log in](https://app.graphsignal.com/) to Graphsignal to monitor and analyze your application.


## Overhead

Graphsignal tracer is highly lightweight. The overhead per trace is measured to be less than 100 microseconds. While profiling can introduce slight overhead, the profiling rate it is limited.


## Security and Privacy

The Graphsignal tracer only establishes outbound connections to `api.graphsignal.com` to send data; inbound connections or commands are not possible.

Content and sensitive information, such as prompts and completions, are not recorded.


## Troubleshooting

To enable debug logging, add `debug_mode=True` to `configure()`. If the debug log doesnâ€™t provide hints for resolving the issue, report it to our support team via your account.

In case of connection issues, please make sure outgoing connections to `https://api.graphsignal.com` are allowed.
