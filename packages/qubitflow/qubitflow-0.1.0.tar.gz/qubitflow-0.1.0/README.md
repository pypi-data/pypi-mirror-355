# QubitFlow

**QubitFlow** is an open-source quantum computing framework based on python designed to be intuitive, scalable, and modular — bringing the simplicity of TensorFlow and PyTorch to the quantum world.

🚧 **Currently Under Active Development**  
We are laying the foundations for a robust, user-friendly quantum programming interface. The initial push will be live soon!

## 🔍 About the Project

QubitFlow aims to simplify quantum circuit design, simulation, and integration with classical machine learning workflows. Our mission is to:

- Make quantum programming **accessible** to developers and researchers
- Provide a **modular architecture** for rapid experimentation
- Support both **quantum simulation** and **real quantum hardware backends**
- Enable **hybrid quantum-classical models** in a seamless fashion

---

## 📌 Planned Features

- Quantum Circuit API (Tensor-like syntax)
- Backend support for simulators and real quantum processors (Qiskit, Braket, etc.)
- Parameterized gates and optimization routines
- Integration with NumPy, PyTorch, and JAX
- Quantum datasets and benchmarking tools
- Visualization of quantum states and circuits
