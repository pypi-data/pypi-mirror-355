# üîß MetaForge

MetaForge is a modular Python toolkit for solving **Job Shop Scheduling Problems (JSSP)** using classic **metaheuristics** and modern **reinforcement learning** methods.

üöÄ From Tabu Search and Genetic Algorithms to Deep Q-Networks (DQN) and Neuroevolution ‚Äî MetaForge brings together the best of optimization and AI in one clean, extensible framework.

  - Tabu Search (TS)
  - Simulated Annealing (SA)
  - Genetic Algorithm (GA)
  - Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)
  - Q-Learning
  - DQN (with and without replay buffer)
  - Neuroevolution
- üìä Beautiful convergence and Gantt chart visualizations

## üì¶ Installation

From PyPI:

```bash
pip install metaforge
```

From GitHub (latest):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/Mageed-Ghaleb/MetaForge.git
```

---

## üìÅ Quick Start

```python
from metaforge.problems.benchmark_loader import load_job_shop_instance
from metaforge.metaforge_runner import run_solver

# Load a benchmark from URL
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mageed-Ghaleb/MetaForge/main/data/benchmarks/ft06.txt"
problem = load_job_shop_instance(url)

# Run a solver
result = run_solver("ts", problem)

# View makespan
print("Best Makespan:", result["makespan"])
```

---

## üìä Visualizations

```python
from metaforge.utils.visualization import plot_gantt_chart
schedule = result["schedules"][-1]
plot_gantt_chart(schedule, num_machines=problem.num_machines, num_jobs=len(problem.jobs))
```
