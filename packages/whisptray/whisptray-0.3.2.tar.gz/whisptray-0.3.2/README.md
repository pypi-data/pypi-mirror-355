# Whisptray

A simple dictation program that uses OpenAI's Whisper for speech-to-text, 
`pynput` for simulating keyboard input, and `pystray` for a system tray icon.

## Features

- Real-time dictation using Whisper.
- Types recognized text into the currently active application.
- System tray icon to toggle dictation and exit the application.
- Configurable Whisper model and audio parameters via command-line arguments.

## Installation

Some common prerequisites are required before installation.

**Prerequisites for Ubuntu:**

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libportaudio2 ffmpeg
```

**Prerequisites for Fedora:**

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Development Tools" && sudo dnf install python3-devel alsa-lib-devel ffmpeg
```

**Installation Command:**

```bash
pip3 install whisptray
```

Or if you have a newer system that requires pipx to install Python applications:

```bash
pipx install whisptray
```

## Usage

```bash
whisptray
```

Click the tray icon to toggle dictation. Double click to exit.

If you have an older computer, try:

```bash
whisptray --model tiny
```

This and several other model options offer various performance vs. accurancy tradeoffs. The `turbo` model is the best quality, and is the default. Use the `--help` options for more details.

If `whisptray` fails to start with errors related to audio input (e.g., cannot find microphone, errors from `sounddevice` despite installing prerequisites), please double-check:
*   Your microphone is correctly connected and configured in your OS sound settings.
*   Your Python environment is correctly set up and `sounddevice` installed properly within it.

## Advanced Usage

You can customize the behavior using command-line arguments. For example, to use a specific microphone (ID 2, found by running with `--device list`) and a different energy multiplier:

```bash
whisptray --device 2 --energy_multiplier 2.0
```

**Available arguments:**

*   `--device DEVICE`: Microphone name or ID to use (e.g., "pulse", "USB Microphone", or an integer ID like `1`). 
    Pass `list` to see available microphone IDs and names. If omitted, the system default microphone is used.
*   `--model MODEL`: Whisper model to use. (choices: "tiny", "base", "small", "medium", "large", "turbo"; default: "turbo").
*   `--max_key_rate COUNT`: The maximum rate of generated keyboard events per second. Higher values are more responsive. Lower values give better compatibility with slow apps. Robust apps can tolerate up to `--max-key-rate 1000`, while the glitchiest only work as low as `--max-key-rate 50`.
*   `--ambient_duration SECONDS`: Duration (in seconds) to measure ambient noise before starting dictation. This helps set a baseline for voice activity detection. (default: 1.0)
*   `--energy_multiplier MULTIPLIER`: Multiplier applied to the measured ambient noise level to set the energy threshold for voice activity detection. Higher values are less sensitive. (default: 1.5)
*   `-v`, `--verbose`: Enable debug logging.
*   `--version`: Show program's version number and exit.
*   `--help`: Show the program's options and exit.

## Troubleshooting

If the text appears garbled in some applications, trying specifying a slower key rate using the `--max_key_rate` command line argument.

## Development

1. Ensure thesystem prerequisites are installed as described in the Installation section.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/coder0xff/whisptray.git # Replace with your repo URL
