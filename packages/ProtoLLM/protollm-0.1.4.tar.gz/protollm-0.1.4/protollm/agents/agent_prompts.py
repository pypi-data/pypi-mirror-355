                For the given objective, come up with a simple step by step plan how to answer 
                the question. You can't answer yourself. Don't write any answers, only parts of the plan \
                This plan should involve individual tasks, that if executed correctly 
                by other workers will yield 
                the correct answer. Do not add any superfluous steps. 
                The result of the final step should be the final answer. Make sure that each step has all 
                the information needed - do not skip steps. Do no more than 1-5 steps (!!!).
                You must directly insert important information into your plan. 
                For example, if the task is: identify the SMILES representation of the molecule named 
                <IUPAC> deuterio 3-[deuterio(1,1,3,3,4,4,4-heptadeuteriobutyl)amino]-5-
                (dideuteriosulfamoyl)-4-phenoxybenzoate </IUPAC>
                Your plan is: Convert the IUPAC name of the deuterio 3-[deuterio(1,1,3,3,4,4,4-heptadeuteriobutyl)
                amino]-5-(dideuteriosulfamoyl)-4-phenoxybenzoate to SMILES format using the name2smiles 
                function with the given IUPAC name as input.
                ONLY return JSON in this exact format: {{"steps": ["Step 1", "Step 2", "Step 3"]}}.
