# `fabricatio-tagging`

An extension of fabricatio, provide capalability to tag on data.

---

## üì¶ Installation

This package is part of the `fabricatio` monorepo and can be installed as an optional dependency:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[tagging]
```

Or install all components:

```bash
pip install fabricatio[full]
```

## üîç Overview

Provides essential tools for:

### Data Tagging
This package enables the tagging of data. It can analyze the input data, whether it's text, numerical data, or structured objects, and assign relevant tags based on predefined rules or machine - learning algorithms. For example, in a text document, it can tag entities such as names, locations, and dates.

### Tag Management
It offers features for managing the tags. This includes creating, editing, and deleting tags, as well as organizing them into hierarchies or categories. For instance, users can group related tags together for easier management and retrieval.

### Integration with Fabricatio
The package is designed to work seamlessly with the Fabricatio framework. It can integrate with other modules in the Fabricatio ecosystem, such as the agent framework, to use the tagged data in more complex workflows.

## üß© Key Features

### Intelligent Tagging
The intelligent tagging feature uses advanced algorithms to automatically assign tags to data. It can understand the semantics of the data and make accurate tag assignments. For example, it can recognize the context of a sentence in a text and assign appropriate tags based on the meaning.

### Customizable Tagging Rules
Users can define their own tagging rules according to their specific needs. This allows for flexibility in the tagging process. For example, in a business application, users can define rules to tag transactions based on their amount, type, and other criteria.

### Tag Search and Retrieval
The package provides functionality for searching and retrieving tagged data. Users can search for data based on specific tags or combinations of tags. This is useful for quickly finding relevant information in a large dataset.

## üîó Dependencies

Core dependencies:

- `fabricatio-core` - Core interfaces and utilities
This dependency provides the fundamental building blocks for the Fabricatio framework. It includes interfaces for task management, event handling, and data models. The `fabricatio-tagging` package uses these interfaces to interact with other modules in the Fabricatio ecosystem and ensure the smooth operation of the tagging process.
