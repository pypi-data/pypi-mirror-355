## What is Taipy templates

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our
[website](https://www.taipy.io). Taipy is split into multiple packages including *taipy-templates*
to let users install the minimum they need.

Taipy templates is a repository that contains application templates created and
maintained by Taipy. It helps users getting started with a simple and ready-to-go application.

To create a Taipy application using this template, first you need to install Taipy (> 2.2).
Then from a terminal, run the following command.
```bash
taipy create
```
or
```bash
taipy create --application "default"
```

After providing necessary information, your new application is created in the current
working directory.

## Installation

The latest stable version of *taipy-templates* is available through *pip*:
```bash
pip install taipy-templates
```

You can install the development version of *taipy-templates* with *pip* and *git* via the taipy repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://git@github.com/Avaiga/taipy
```

This command installs the development version of *taipy* package in the Python environment with all
its dependencies, including the *taipy-templates* package.

If you need the source code for *taipy-templates* on your system so you can see how things are done or
maybe participate in the improvement of the packages, you can clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy.git
```

This creates the 'taipy' directory holding all the package's source code, and the 'taipy-templates'
source code is in the 'taipy/templates' directory.
