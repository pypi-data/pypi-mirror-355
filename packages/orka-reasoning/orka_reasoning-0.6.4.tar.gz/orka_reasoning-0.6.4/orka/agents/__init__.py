"""
OrKa Agents Package
=================

This package contains all agent implementations for the OrKa framework.
Agents are the fundamental building blocks that perform specific tasks
within orchestrated workflows.

Available Agent Types:
-------------------
- Base Agent: Abstract base class that defines the agent interface
  - Modern BaseAgent: Async implementation with full concurrency support
  - Legacy BaseAgent: Backward-compatible synchronous implementation
- Binary Agent: Makes binary (yes/no) decisions based on input
- Classification Agent: Classifies input into predefined categories
- LLM Agents: Integrations with large language models (OpenAI, Local LLMs)
- Validation Agent: Validates answers and structures them into memory objects
"""
