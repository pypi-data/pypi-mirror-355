"""
Memory Logger
============

The Memory Logger is a critical component of the OrKa framework that provides
persistent storage and retrieval capabilities for orchestration events, agent outputs,
and system state. It serves as both a runtime memory system and an audit trail for
agent workflows.

Key Features:
------------
1. Event Logging: Records all agent activities and system events
2. Data Persistence: Stores data in Redis streams for reliability
3. Serialization: Handles conversion of complex Python objects to JSON-serializable formats
4. Error Resilience: Implements fallback mechanisms for handling serialization errors
5. Querying: Provides methods to retrieve recent events and specific data points
6. File Export: Supports exporting memory logs to files for analysis

The Memory Logger is essential for:
- Enabling agents to access past context and outputs
- Debugging and auditing agent workflows
- Maintaining state across distributed components
- Supporting complex workflow patterns like fork/join

Implementation Notes:
-------------------
- Uses Redis streams as the primary storage backend
- Maintains an in-memory buffer for fast access to recent events
- Implements robust sanitization to handle non-serializable objects
- Provides helper methods for common Redis operations
- Includes a placeholder for future Kafka-based implementation
