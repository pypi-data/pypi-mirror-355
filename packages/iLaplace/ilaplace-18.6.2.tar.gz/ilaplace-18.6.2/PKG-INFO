Inverse Laplace â€” Simple Interface for Powerful Math
inverse-laplace is a lightweight Python wrapper around advanced symbolic and numerical math tools (sympy, mpmath, scipy) that provides a clean and intuitive interface for computing inverse Laplace transforms using Talbotâ€™s method.

Why This Library?
If you've ever tried to compute inverse Laplace transforms numerically in Python, you've probably noticed:
mpmath.invertlaplace() is powerful but raw and low-level
sympy gives symbolic transforms, but not numerical answers
Combining them can be verbose and repetitive

In short: You focus on the math, we handle the machinery.
