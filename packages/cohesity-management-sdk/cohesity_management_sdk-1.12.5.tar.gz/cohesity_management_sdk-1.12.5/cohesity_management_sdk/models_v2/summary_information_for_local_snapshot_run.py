class SummaryInformationForLocalSnapshotRun(object):

    """Implementation of the 'Summary information for local snapshot run.' model.

    Specifies summary information about local snapshot run across all
    objects.

    Attributes:
        run_type (RunTypeEnum): Type of Protection Group run. 'kRegular'
            indicates an incremental (CBT) backup. Incremental backups
            utilizing CBT (if supported) are captured of the target protection
            objects. The first run of a kRegular schedule captures all the
            blocks. 'kFull' indicates a full (no CBT) backup. A complete
            backup (all blocks) of the target protection objects are always
            captured and Change Block Tracking (CBT) is not utilized. 'kLog'
            indicates a Database Log backup. Capture the database transaction
            logs to allow rolling back to a specific point in time. 'kSystem'
            indicates system volume backup. It produces an image for bare
            metal recovery.
        is_sla_violated (bool): Indicated if SLA has been violated for this
            run.
        start_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the start time of backup run in
            Unix epoch Timestamp(in microseconds).
        end_time_usecs (long|int): Specifies the end time of backup run in
            Unix epoch Timestamp(in microseconds).
        skipped_objects_count (long|int): Specifies the count of objects for which backup was skipped.
        stats_task_id (string): Stats task id for local backup run.
        status (Status5Enum): Status of the backup run. 'Running' indicates
            that the run is still running. 'Canceled' indicates that the run
            has been canceled. 'Canceling' indicates that the run is in the
            process of being canceled. 'Failed' indicates that the run has
            failed. 'Missed' indicates that the run was unable to take place
            at the scheduled time because the previous run was still
            happening. 'Succeeded' indicates that the run has finished
            successfully. 'SucceededWithWarning' indicates that the run
            finished successfully, but there were some warning messages.
        messages (list of string): Message about the backup run.
        successful_objects_count (long|int): Specifies the count of objects
            for which backup was successful.
        failed_objects_count (long|int): Specifies the count of objects for
            which backup failed.
        cancelled_objects_count (long|int): Specifies the count of objects for
            which backup was cancelled.
        successful_app_objects_count (int): Specifies the count of app objects
            for which backup was successful.
        failed_app_objects_count (int): Specifies the count of app objects for
            which backup failed.
        cancelled_app_objects_count (int): Specifies the count of app objects
            for which backup was cancelled.
        local_snapshot_stats (LocalSnapshotStatistics): Specifies statistics
            about local snapshot.
        indexing_task_id (string): Progress monitor task for indexing.
        progress_task_id (string): Progress monitor task id for local backup
            run.
        data_lock (DataLockEnum): This field is deprecated. Use
            DataLockConstraints field instead.
        local_task_id (string): Task ID for a local protection run.
        data_lock_constraints (DataLockConstraints): Specifies the dataLock
            constraints for local or target snapshot.
