class CreateProtectionGroupRunRequest(object):

    """Implementation of the 'CreateProtectionGroupRunRequest' model.

    Specifies the request to create a protection run. On success, the system
    will accept the request and return the Protection Group id for which the
    run is supposed to start. The actual run may start at a later time if the
    system is busy. Consumers must query the Protection Group to see the run.

    Attributes:
        run_type (RunType2Enum): Type of protection run. 'kRegular' indicates
            an incremental (CBT) backup. Incremental backups utilizing CBT (if
            supported) are captured of the target protection objects. The
            first run of a kRegular schedule captures all the blocks. 'kFull'
            indicates a full (no CBT) backup. A complete backup (all blocks)
            of the target protection objects are always captured and Change
            Block Tracking (CBT) is not utilized. 'kLog' indicates a Database
            Log backup. Capture the database transaction logs to allow rolling
            back to a specific point in time. 'kSystem' indicates system
            volume backup. It produces an image for bare metal recovery.
        objects (list of RunObject): Specifies the list of objects to be
            protected by this Protection Group run. These can be leaf objects
            or non-leaf objects in the protection hierarchy. This must be
            specified only if a subset of objects from the Protection Groups
            needs to be protected.
        targets_config (TargetConfiguration): Specifies the replication and
            archival targets.
