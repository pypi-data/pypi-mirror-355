To configure this module, you need to:

1.  Add to the "Restrict Product Pricelist" group those users whose access
    to product pricelists might be limited.
2.  The product pricelist form view has two fields to control the access:
    "Access Users" and "Access Groups". Users included in "Access Users"
    field that also belong to the "Restrict Product Pricelist" group will
    be granted access to the pricelist. If "Access Users" field is left
    empty in a pricelist, all users will have access to the pricelist
    (including those users in the "Restrict Product Pricelist"). When
    adding a new group to the "Access Groups" field, users in the selected
    groups will be added to the "Access Users" field. Keep in mind that
    removing groups from the "Access Groups" field does not remove users
    in the "Access Users" fields.
