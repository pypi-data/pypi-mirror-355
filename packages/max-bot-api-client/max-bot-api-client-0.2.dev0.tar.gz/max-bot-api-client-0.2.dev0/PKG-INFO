    # About Bot API allows bots to interact with Max. Methods are called by sending HTTPS requests to [botapi.max.ru](https://botapi.max.ru) domain. Bots are third-party applications that use Max features. A bot can legitimately take part in a conversation. It can be achieved through HTTP requests to the Max Bot API.  ## Features Max bots of the current version are able to: - Communicate with users and respond to requests - Recommend users complete actions via programmed buttons - Request personal data from users (name, short reference, phone number) We&#39;ll keep working on expanding bot capabilities in the future.
