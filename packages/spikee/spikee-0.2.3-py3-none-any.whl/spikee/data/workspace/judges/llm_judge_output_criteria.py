llm_judge_output_criteria.py

A judge for spikee that calls an external LLM 
to evaluate the model's output against some custom criteria.

Usage:
  1. Place this file in your `judges/` folder.
  2. In your dataset JSON, set:
       "judge_name": "llm_judge_output_criteria"
       "judge_args": "dangerous and inappropriate content"
  3. The tester will call judge(llm_input, llm_output, judge_args).
     This code then asks gpt4o-mini if llm_output meets the criteria.
