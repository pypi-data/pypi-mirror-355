prompt_decomposition_dumb.py

An attack module for Spikee that tests LLM applications against prompt decomposition vulnerabilities
by sequentially trying different labeled chunk reformulations.

This attack decomposes a prompt into parts using basic heuristics, labels them,
and generates several naive reformulations with shuffled parts to challenge positional bias
and force semantic parsing.

Attack Interface:
    attack(entry, target_module, call_judge, max_iterations, attempts_bar=None)

Arguments:
    entry: dict
        The dataset item (must include "text" field).
    target_module: module
        The target module providing process_input(input_text, system_message).
    call_judge: function
        A function that judges the LLM output: call_judge(entry, llm_output) -> bool.
    max_iterations: int
        Maximum number of attack iterations to try.
    attempts_bar: tqdm progress bar (optional)
        If provided, the attack will update it during its iterations.

Returns:
    A tuple: (iterations_attempted, success_flag, last_payload, last_response)
