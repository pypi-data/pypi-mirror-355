# dateling

🕰 **dateling — A Time Expression DSL and parser for deterministic date calculations.**

`dateling` provides a normalized formal language (DSL) to represent and resolve date calculations using structured expressions.  
Instead of parsing ambiguous natural language, it offers a precise syntax to express relative and absolute dates, compute date ranges, and perform robust date arithmetic.

The name `dateling` comes from combining **date** and **handling**.

## 🚀 Why dateling?

Most existing packages like `dateparser` or `parsedatetime` try to interpret free-text natural language into dates.  
In contrast, `dateling` takes a **strict, declarative, and composable approach**, offering:

- ✅ Predictable & reproducible date evaluation
- ✅ Fully composable date expressions
- ✅ Explicit syntax without ambiguity
- ✅ Ideal for any system requiring controlled time range calculations
- ✅ No natural language processing — purely deterministic time logic

## 📅 DSL Syntax

The general expression format is:

```text
{anchor [+/- offset] | [modifiers]}
```

### Anchors:

* `today` (system reference date)
* `YYYYMMDD` (e.g. `20250101`)
* `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g. `2025-01-01`)

### Offsets:

* Days: `+Nd`, `-Nd`
* Months: `+Nm`, `-Nm`
* Years: `+Ny`, `-Ny`

### Modifiers:

* `year_start` → resolves to start of year
* `year_end` → resolves to end of year
* `year=nearest_year` → use anchor year, fallback to previous year if resulting date is in the future
* `year=YYYY` → explicitly set year
* `month=MM` → override month
* `day=DD` → override day

## 📊 Examples

| DSL Expression                  | Meaning                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `{today}` | today's date |
| `{today -1d}` | 1 day before today |
| `{today -1y \| year_start}` | start of year, 1 year ago |
| `{2025-01-01 +30y \| year_end}` | year-end of 30 years after Jan 1, 2025|
| `{today \| year=nearest_year, month=03, day=10}` | resolves to March 10 of anchor year (or previous year if future) |
| `{year=2023, month=05, day=15}` | absolute date |

## ⚙ Usage

```python
from dateling import DatelingResolver

resolver = DatelingResolver()
date = resolver.resolve("{today -1y | year_start}")
print(date)
```

You may also set a fixed reference date:

```python
resolver = DatelingResolver(reference_date="2025-06-11")
date = resolver.resolve("{today -3y | year_end}")
print(date)
```

```bash
pip install dateling
```

(Once released to PyPI)
