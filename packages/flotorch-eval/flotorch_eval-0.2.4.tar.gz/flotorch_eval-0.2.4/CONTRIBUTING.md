# Contributing to Agent-Eval

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Agent-Eval as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agent-eval.git
cd agent-eval
```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install development dependencies:
```bash
make install-dev
```

4. Run tests:
```bash
make test
```

5. Format code:
```bash
make format
```

6. Run linters:
```bash
make lint
```

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, if applicable.
2. Update the version numbers in `pyproject.toml` and `setup.py` following [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/).
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one other developer.

## Report bugs using GitHub's [issue tracker](https://github.com/yourusername/agent-eval/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/agent-eval/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
