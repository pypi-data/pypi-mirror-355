    "Initialization: A dictionary data is created and then converted into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "Vectorized Operation: A new Bonus column is created by multiplying the entire Salary column by 0.1. This is a fast, vectorized operation.\n",
    "Boolean Filtering: A boolean mask (df['Age'] > 30) is created to select and display only the rows that meet this condition.\n",
    "Binning: The pd.cut function is used to segment the Age data into discrete intervals (bins), which are then assigned descriptive labels.\n",

    "1. **Years 1-2:** \n",
    "   - Aggressively pay off your $25,000 student loan (approximately 12 months)\n",
    "   - Build emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses ($7,740-$13,900)\n",

    "   - Continue retirement contributions\n",
    "   - Monitor real estate market trends\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retirement by Age 55:\n",
    "1. **Start Now:**\n",
    "   - Contribute 15% of your income to retirement accounts ($10,800/year)\n",
    "   - Maximize employer match if available\n",
    "   - Use tax-advantaged accounts (401(k), IRA)\n",

    "2. **After Home Purchase:**\n",

    "   - Increase contributions as income grows\n",
    "   - Review and rebalance investments annually\n",
    "\n",
