# Carrot Cake Recipe

Ingredients:

2 cups all-purpose flour
2 teaspoons baking soda
2 teaspoons ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
4 eggs
1 1/2 cups vegetable oil
2 cups white sugar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
3 cups grated carrots
1 cup chopped pecans (optional)

Instructions:

Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan.
In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.
In a large bowl, beat eggs, oil, sugar, and vanilla until well blended.
Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet mixture, stirring until just combined.
Fold in the grated carrots and chopped pecans (if using).
Pour the batter into the prepared pan.
Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.
Allow to cool in the pan for 10 minutes, then turn out onto a wire rack to cool completely.
Once cooled, you can frost with cream cheese frosting if desired.
