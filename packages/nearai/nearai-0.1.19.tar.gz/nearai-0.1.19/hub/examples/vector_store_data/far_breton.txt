# Far Breton Recipe

Ingredients:

4 cups (1 liter) whole milk
4 large eggs
1 cup (200g) granulated sugar
1 cup (125g) all-purpose flour
1 tablespoon vanilla extract
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 cup (150g) prunes, pitted
2 tablespoons rum (optional)

Instructions:

If using rum, soak the prunes in it for at least 1 hour or overnight.
Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Grease a 9x13 inch (23x33 cm) baking dish.
In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs and sugar until well combined.
Gradually add the flour, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.
Slowly pour in the milk, continuing to whisk until the batter is smooth.
Add the vanilla extract and salt, and mix well.
Pour the batter into the prepared baking dish.
Distribute the prunes (drained if soaked in rum) evenly throughout the batter.
Bake for about 45-50 minutes, or until the top is golden brown and a knife inserted in the center comes out clean.
Allow to cool for at least 15 minutes before serving. Far Breton can be served warm or at room temperature.
Optionally, dust with powdered sugar before serving.

This dessert has a custard-like texture and is typically served as is, without any additional toppings or garnishes. The prunes can be substituted with raisins or other dried fruits if preferred. Enjoy your homemade Far Breton!
