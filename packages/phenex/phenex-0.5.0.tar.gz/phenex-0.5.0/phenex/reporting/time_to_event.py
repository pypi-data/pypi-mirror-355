    Perform a time to event analysis.

    The time_to_event table is first generated, after which, by default, a Kaplan Meier plot is generated. The time_to_event table contains one row per patient and then multiple columns containing

    ### Dates
    1. the index date for each patient
    2. the dates of all outcomes or NULL if they did not occur
    3. the dates of all right censoring events or NULL if they did not occur
    4. the date of the end of the study, if provided
    5. the days from index to the dates provided above
    6. the

    | Column | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | `date` columns | The EVENT_DATE of every 1. cohort outcome phenotype and 2. the right censoring phenotypes, if provided. The column name for the respective EVENT_DATE is the name of the phenotype. 3. Additionally, the date of the end of study period is present, if provided. |
    | `days_to_event` columns | For each `date` column, the number of days from index_date to the `date` column. These columns begin with “DAYS_TO_” and the name of the `date` column. |
    | `date_first_event` columns | For each outcome phenotype, the `date_first_event` column is added titled “DATE_FIRST_EVENT_{name of outcome phenotype}”. This is the first date that occurs post index, whether that outcome, a right censoring event, or the end of study period. |
    | `days_to_first_event` columns | For each outcome phenotype, the `days_to_first_event` column is added titled “DAYS_FIRST_EVENT_{name of outcome phenotype}”. This is the days from index_date to the `date_first_event` column. |
    | `indicator` columns | For each outcome phenotype, the `indicator` column is added titled “INDICATOR_{name of outcome phenotype}”. This has a value of 1 if the first event was the outcome phenotype, or a 0 if the first event was a right censoring event or the end of study period. |

    Parameters:
        right_censor_phenotypes: A list of phenotypes that should be used as right censoring events. Suggested are death and end of followup.
