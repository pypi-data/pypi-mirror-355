# InitDecaytor
##### _Thermal decomposition of free-radical initiators_

The purpose of this program is to simulate the thermal decomposition of 
free radical initiators based on literature kinetic data and a set of (virtual)
experimental parameters, such as the concentration and temperature.  

Currently, multiple charges of a variety of radical initiators are supported 
at a constant temperature. The end-time of the experiment can be visually represented
based on a desired threshold of initiator relative to its maximum concentration.
