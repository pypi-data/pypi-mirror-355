## Installation

To install the package via PyPI, simply run:

```bash
pip install ioa_observe_sdk
```

Alternatively, to download the SDK from git, you could also use the following command. Ensure you have `uv` installed in your environment.

```bash
uv add "git+https://github.com/agntcy/observe"
```

## Schema

The AGNTCY observability schema is an extension of the OTel LLM Semantic Conventions for Generative AI systems.
This schema is designed to provide comprehensive observability for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS).

## Dev

To get started with development, start a Clickhouse DB and an OTel collector container locally using docker-compose like so:

```
cd deploy/
docker compose up -d
```

Ensure the contents of `otel-collector.yaml` is correct.

Check the logs of the collector to ensure it is running correctly:

```
docker logs -f otel-collector
```

Create a `.env` file with the following content:

```bash
OTLP_HTTP_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:4318
```

Install the dependencies and activate the virtual environment:

```bash
set -a
source .env
set +a

python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv sync
```

## Testing

To run the unit tests, ensure you have the `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in your environment. You can run the tests using the following command:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=<KEY> make test
```
