comment: Measurement of inclusive production cross section of pairs of isolated prompt
  photons with the ATLAS Detector at centre-of-mass energy 13 TeV.The transverse momentum
  of the photons is required to be greater than 40(30) GeV for the (sub)leading photon.
  The photons are required to be seperated by more than $\Delta R > 0.4$. The photons
  are required to be isolated with $E_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{iso}<0.09\cdot p_{\mathrm{T},\gamma}$.
  The isolation energy $E_\mathrm{T}^\mathrm{iso}$ is defined as the scalar sum of
  the transverse momenta of particles in a cone of $\Delta R < 0.2$ around the photon
  and is corrected for the transverse momentum density of jets in the event.For each
  differential cross section measurement 100 data bootstrap replicas are provided
  in the resources which should be used to estimate the statistical uncertainty and
  the correlations between different observables. For convenience the statitistical
  uncertainties are also contained in the main tables.The systematic uncertainties
  can be considered fully correlated and seperate up-and down-variations are provided.
  Sometimes the up-and down-variations have the same sign. The uncertainties need
  to be symmetrized before calculating chi2 values.
