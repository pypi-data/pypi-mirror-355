comment: A search for emerging jets produced in proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass
  energy of $13\,\text{TeV}$ is performed using data collected by the CMS experiment,
  corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $138\,\text{fb}^{-1}$. This search
  examines a hypothetical dark QCD sector that couples to the standard model (SM)
  through a scalar mediator. The scalar mediator decays into a standard model quark
  and a dark sector quark. As the dark sector quark showers and hadronizes, it produces
  long-lived dark mesons that subsequently decay into SM particles, resulting in a
  jet with multiple displaced vertices, known as an emerging jet. This search looks
  for pair production of the scalar mediators at the LHC, yielding events with two
  SM jets and two emerging jets. The results are interpreted using two dark sector
  models and exclude mediator masses up to $1800\,\text{GeV}$ for an unflavored dark
  QCD model, and up to $1950\,\text{GeV}$ for a flavored-aligned dark QCD model.

description: Distribution of event $H_\mathrm{T}$ of CMS data, SM multijet MC events,
  and various signal samples. Events are required to pass the trigger requirements
  and also have 4 jets with $p_\mathrm{T}>100$GeV. The distribution from various processes
  have their total count normalized to 1.
