This is a command for creating a skeleton project for python commands. It uses
uv to boot strap the project and install an environment. Helpful utilities for
installing the project are given, wee below.

Template that this uses is here:
  * https://github.com/zackees/template-python-cmd

```python
> pip install create-python-cmd
> git clone https://github.com/.../myproject
> cd myproject
> createpythoncmd # Creates a new Python command line application.

  * `test` - runs the unit test

# Linters

The following linters are used
