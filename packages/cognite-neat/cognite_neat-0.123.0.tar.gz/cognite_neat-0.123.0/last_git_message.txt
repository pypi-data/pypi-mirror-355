[NEAT-1004] üßë‚Äçüè´ Support index cursorable (#1218)

# Description

Validation for this new syntax is introduced in #1230 

**Context** The neat spreadsheet format is (with the exception of
filters) a one-to-one with the DMS API for containers, views, and data
models. We are currently missing setting `cursorable` on btree indexes.
This PR introduces it.

Adds support for setting index. 
* Introduce a `ContainerIndexEntity` to store the information. This is
following the same pattern that we use for example Units.
* Replace the `list[str]` with `list[ContainerIndexEntity]` for physical
properties.

## Changelog
### Added

- Support for setting `cursorable` when specifying an index on container
properties.

### Fixed

- Neat can now specify and maintains the order of multi-property order
on indices. You do this with the syntax,
`btree:multipPropertyIntdex(order=1)` in the Index column of the
physical data model spreadsheet.

### Changed

- When setting an index on a property(ies) with a listable container,
Neat uses an `InvertedIndex` instead of a `BTreeIndex`.
