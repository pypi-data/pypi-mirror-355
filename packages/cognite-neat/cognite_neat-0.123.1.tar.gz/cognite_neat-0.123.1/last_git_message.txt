[NEAT-958, NEAT-811]  Check instance limit (#1222)

# Description

**Context**: We had incidents were neat has caused other applications to
fail. This happen as the result of the user creating large amounts of
instances in CDF using neat and filling up the instance capacity of the
CDF project. This adds a fail-safe that stops the user from using neat
to fill up to the instance limit in a CDF project and leave a margin
such that other applications can continue to add new instances.

## Bump

- [x] Patch
- [ ] Minor
- [ ] Skip

## Changelog
### Fixed

- When writing instances (nodes and edges) to CDF using the
`neat.to.cdf.instance()` method, Neat now checks that CDF will have at
least free space for 500 000 instances after the writing is done.
