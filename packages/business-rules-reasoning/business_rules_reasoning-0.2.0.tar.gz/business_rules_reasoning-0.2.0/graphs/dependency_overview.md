    %% Explanations:
    %% - LLMOrchestrator coordinates the reasoning process, interacts with the Reasoning Engine, LLM Pipeline, and loads the Knowledge Base.
    %% - Reasoning Engine performs logical inference using the Knowledge Base and maintains its own State.
    %% - LLM Pipeline is used by the orchestrator for fact extraction and prompt handling.
    %% - Knowledge Base contains rules, predicates, and variables used by the Reasoning Engine.
    %% - State is managed exclusively by the Reasoning Engine to track reasoning progress.
