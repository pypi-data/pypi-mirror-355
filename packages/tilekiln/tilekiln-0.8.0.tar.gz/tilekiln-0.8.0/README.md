# Tilekiln

## Background

Tilekiln is a set of command-line utilities to generate and serve Mapbox Vector Tiles (MVTs).

Generation relies on the standard method of a PostgreSQL + PostGIS server as a data source, and ST_AsMVT to serialize the MVTs.

The target use-case is vector tiles for a worldwide complex basemap under high load which requires minutely updates. If only daily updates are required options like [tilemaker](https://tilemaker.org/) or [planetiler](https://github.com/onthegomap/planetiler) may be simpler to host.

## Requirements

Tilekiln requires a PostGIS database with data loaded to generate vector tiles.

[OpenStreetMap Carto's](https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto/blob/master/INSTALL.md#openstreetmap-data) directions are a good starting place for loading OpenStreetMap data into a PostGIS database, but any PostGIS data source in EPSG 3857 will work.

- PostgreSQL 10+
- PostGIS 3.1+
- Python 3.10

## Concepts

Tilekiln issues queries against a *source* database to generate Mapbox Vector Tile (MVT) layers, assembles the layers into a tile, then either serves the tile to the user or stores it in a *storage* database. It can also serve previously generated tiles from the *storage* database which completely removes the *source* database out of the critical path for serving tiles.

Utility commands allow checking of configurations, storage management, and debugging as well as commands for monitoring metrics needed in production.

## Usage
Tilekiln commands can be broken into two sets, commands which involve serving tiles, and CLI commands. Command-line options can be found with `tilekiln --help`, which includes a listing and description of all options.

### CLI commands
CLI commands will perform a task then exit, returning to ther shell.

#### `config`
Commands to work with and check config files

##### `config test`
Tests a config for validity.

The process will exit with exit code 0 if tilekiln can load the config.

This is intended for build and CI scripts used by configs.

##### `config sql`
Print the SQL for a tile or layer.

Prints the SQL that would be issued to generate a particular tile layer,
or if no layer is given, the entire tile. This allows manual debugging of
a tile query.

#### `generate`
Commands for tile generation.

All tile generation commands run queries against the source database which
has the geospatial data.

##### `generate tiles`
Generate specific tiles.

A list of z/x/y tiles is read from stdin and those tiles are generated and
saved to storage. The entire list is read before deletion starts.

##### `generate zoom`
Generate all tiles by zoom.

##### `generate layers`
Generate specific layers for specific tiles.

#### `storage`
Commands working with tile storage.

These commands allow creation and manipulation of the tile storage database.

##### `storage init`
Initialize storage for a tileset.

Creates the storage for a tile layer and stores its metadata in the database.
If the metadata tables have not yet been created they will also be setup.

##### `storage destroy`
Destroy storage for a tileset.

Removes the storage for a tile layer and deletes its associated metadata.
The metadata tables themselves are not removed.

##### `storage inspect`
Print data about a stored tile

##### `storage delete`
Mass-delete tiles from a tileset

Deletes tiles from a tileset, by zoom, or delete all zooms.

##### `storage tiledelete`
Delete specific tiles.

A list of z/x/y tiles is read from stdin and those tiles are deleted from
storage. The entire list is read before deletion starts.

### Serving commands
These commands start a HTTP server to serve content.
#### `serve`
Commands for tile serving.

All tile serving commands serve tiles and a tilejson over HTTP.

##### `dev`
Starts a server to live-render tiles with no caching, intended for development. It presents a tilejson at `/<id>/tilejson.json`, and for convience `/tilejson.json` redirects to it.

##### `live`
Like `serve`, but fall back to live generation if a tile is missing from storage.

It presents a tilejson at `/<id>/tilejson.json`.

##### `static`
Serves tiles from tile storage. This is highly scalable and the preferred mode for production.

It presents a tilejson at `/<id>/tilejson.json`. In the future it will allow serving multiple tilesets.

#### `prometheus`
Starts a prometheus exporter for metrics on tiles. By default it presents metrics at `http://127.0.0.1:10013/metrics`.

## Quick-start
These instructions give you a setup based on osm2pgsql-themepark and their shortbread setup. They assume you have PostgreSQL with PostGIS and Python 3.10+ with venv set up, and a recent version of osm2pgsql.

### Install and setup

```sh
python3 -m venv tilekiln
tilekiln/bin/pip install tilekiln
tilekiln/bin/tilekiln --help
```

### Configuration Setup

Tilekiln requires a configuration file that defines the contents of your vector tiles. Most configurations are designed to work with OpenStreetMap data loaded into PostgreSQL using osm2pgsql.

For a configuration, you can use the one provided by the [Street Spirit](https://github.com/pnorman/spirit) project. Follow its [installation guide](https://github.com/pnorman/spirit/blob/main/INSTALL.md) to get started.

## History
The tilekiln configuration syntax is based on studies and experience with other vector tile and map generation configurations. In particular, it is heavily inspired by Tilezen's use of Jinja2 templates and TileJSON for necessary metadata.
