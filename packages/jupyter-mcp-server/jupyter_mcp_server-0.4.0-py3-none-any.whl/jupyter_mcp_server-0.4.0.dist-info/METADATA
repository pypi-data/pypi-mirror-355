# ü™ê‚ú® Jupyter MCP Server

[![PyPI - Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/jupyter-mcp-server)](https://pypi.org/project/jupyter-mcp-server)
[![smithery badge](https://smithery.ai/badge/@datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server)](https://smithery.ai/server/@datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server)

**Jupyter MCP Server** is a [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) (MCP) server implementation that provides interaction with üìì Jupyter notebooks running in any JupyterLab (works also with your üíª local JupyterLab).

## üöÄ Key Features

- ‚ö° **Real-time control:** Instantly view notebook changes as they happen.
- üîÅ **Smart execution:** Automatically adjusts when a cell run fails thanks to cell output feedback.
- ü§ù **MCP-Compatible:** Works with any MCP client, such as Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, and more.

![Jupyter MCP Server Demo](https://assets.datalayer.tech/jupyter-mcp/jupyter-mcp-server-claude-demo.gif)

üõ†Ô∏è This MCP offers multiple tools such as `insert_execute_code_cell`, `append_markdown_cell`, `get_notebook_info`, `read_cell`, and more, enabling advanced interactions with Jupyter notebooks. Explore our [Tools documentation](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/docs/tools) to learn about all the tools powering Jupyter MCP Server.

## üèÅ Getting Started

Follow our [Setup Guide](https://jupyter-mcp-server.datalayer.tech/docs/setup) or use the quick steps below:

### 1. Set Up Your Environment

```bash
pip install jupyterlab==4.4.1 jupyter-collaboration==4.0.2 ipykernel
pip uninstall -y pycrdt datalayer_pycrdt
pip install datalayer_pycrdt==0.12.17
```

### 2. Start JupyterLab

```bash
jupyter lab --port 8888 --IdentityProvider.token MY_TOKEN --ip 0.0.0.0
```

### 3. Configure Your Preferred MCP Client

#### MacOS and Windows

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "SERVER_URL",
        "-e",
        "TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SERVER_URL": "http://host.docker.internal:8888",
        "TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH": "notebook.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Linux

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jupyter": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "-i",
        "--rm",
        "-e",
        "SERVER_URL",
        "-e",
        "TOKEN",
        "-e",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH",
        "--network=host",
        "datalayer/jupyter-mcp-server:latest"
      ],
      "env": {
        "SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:8888",
        "TOKEN": "MY_TOKEN",
        "NOTEBOOK_PATH": "notebook.ipynb"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
