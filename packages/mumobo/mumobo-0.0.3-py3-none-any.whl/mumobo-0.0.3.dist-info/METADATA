## Usage

The mumobo infrastructure allows to control a set of servos via a socket server running on a microcontroller. This python API facilitates the setup and communication with the servo motors. Currently, the microcontroller can operate two independent sets of motors, each of these sets are called an axis, where the intention is that each axis will operate two to three motors on one mirror mount. For each axis there is a patch cable jack available to route the communication from the mumobo to the mirror mount. At the site of the mirror mount, a small breakout board is used to hook up the servos. 

### How to take servos into operation

Servos are adressed by their unique ID. Before the communication with more than one servo over a shared line can be used they have to be given a unique address. Moreover, one typically wants to operate those servos in step mode, i.e., one wants to tell the servo motor to move by a given number of steps. To stage those motors for operation, the following procedure is foreseen
```python
import mumobo
mmb=mumobo.MuMoBoClient()
# 1. Plug ONLY ONE motor at a time into the breakout board connected to AXIS=1 or 2.
# 2. Find servo-ID: 
mmb.getID(AXIS)
# 3. Change ID from old ID to new ID if the it already exists
mmb.changeID(AXIS, SERVO_ID, NEW_ID)
# 4. Check if the renaming worked 
mmb.ping_1(AXIS, SERVO_ID)
# 5. Switch the motor to Step-mode (this will. like the SERVO_ID be persistantly stored on the servo) 
mmb.Step_Mode(AXIS, SERVO_ID)
```
This step is to be repeated for all motors in use. After this, they can be adressed with their AXIS and newly assigned ID.

## How to turn the servo

```python
AXIS = 1 
Servo_ID = 1
step = 100 
# Number from -10000 (anticlockwise) to  10000 (clockwise). A step of 4096 corresponds to a 360° turn

mmb.move_moto_by_(AXIS, Servo_ID, step)
```
