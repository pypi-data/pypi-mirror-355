# %% [markdown]
# This example demonstrates how binary data (NumPy arrays) can be efficiently transferred
# between Python and JavaScript in both directions. The points are stored as a NumPy array
# in Python, sent to JavaScript for rendering, and any updates from dragging are sent back
# to Python as binary data.

import colight.plot as Plot
import numpy
from colight.plot import js

# Generate points as a NumPy array (binary data)
points = numpy.random.rand(8)

# %% [markdown]
# Create an interactive plot that demonstrates bidirectional binary data transfer:
# - Points are sent to JS as binary data via NumPy array
# - Dragging updates are sent back to Python as binary data
# - Print button shows the data is still a NumPy array in Python
