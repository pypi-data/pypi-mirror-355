# ENACT: End-to-End Analysis and Cell Type Annotation for Visium High Definition (HD) Slides

>[!NOTE]
>This is the official repo for [ENACT](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf094/8063614). The manuscript can be accessed through [Bioinformatics Journal](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article-pdf/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btaf094/62340410/btaf094.pdf).

Spatial transcriptomics (ST) enables the study of gene expression within its spatial context in histopathology samples. To date, a limiting factor has been the resolution of sequencing based ST products. The introduction of the Visium High Definition (HD) technology opens the door to cell resolution ST studies. However, challenges remain in the ability to accurately map transcripts to cells and in cell type assignment based on spot data.

ENACT is the first tissue-agnostic pipeline that integrates advanced cell segmentation with Visium HD transcriptomics data to infer cell types across whole tissue sections. Our pipeline incorporates novel bin-to-cell assignment methods, enhancing the accuracy of single-cell transcript estimates. Validated on diverse synthetic and real datasets, our approach demonstrates high effectiveness at predicting cell types and scalability, offering a robust solution for spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis.

This repository has the code for inferring cell types from the sub-cellular transcript counts provided by VisiumHD.

This can be achieved through the following steps:

1. **Cell segmentation**: segment high resolution image using NN-based image segmentation networks such as Stardist.
2. **Bin-to-cell assignment**: Obtain cell-wise transcript counts by aggregating the VisiumHD bins that are associated with each cell
3. **Cell type inference**: Use the cell-wise transcript counts to infer the cell labels/ phenotypes using methods used for single-cell RNA seq analysis ([CellAsign](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-019-0529-1#:~:text=CellAssign%20uses%20a%20probabilistic%20model%20to%20assign%20single) or [CellTypist](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35549406/#:~:text=To%20systematically%20resolve%20immune%20cell%20heterogeneity%20across%20tissues,) or [Sargent](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2215016123001966#:~:text=We%20present%20Sargent,%20a%20transformation-free,%20cluster-free,%20single-cell%20annotation) if installed) or novel approaches, and use comprehensive cell marker databases ([Panglao](https://panglaodb.se/index.html) or [CellMarker](http://xteam.xbio.top/CellMarker/) can be used as reference).

## System Requirements
ENACT was tested with the following specifications:
* Hardware Requirements: 32 CPU, 64GB RAM, 100 GB (harddisk and memory requirements may vary depending on whole slide image size; if the weight of the wsi is small the memory requirements can be significantly decreased)

* Software: Python 3.10, (Optional) GPU (CUDA 11)

## Install ENACT from Source 
### Step 1: Clone ENACT repository
```
git clone https://github.com/Sanofi-Public/enact-pipeline.git
cd enact-pipeline
```
### Step 2: Setup Python environment
Start by defining the location and the name of the Conda environment in the `Makefile`:
```
ENV_DIR := /home/oneai/envs/   <---- Conda environment location
PY_ENV_NAME := enact_py_env    <---- Conda environment name
```
Next, run the following Make command to create a Conda environment with all of ENACT's dependencies
```
make setup_py_env
```

## Install ENACT with Pip
ENACT can be installed from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/enact-SO/) using:
```
pip install enact-SO
```

## Input Files for ENACT
ENACT requires only three files, which can be obtained from SpaceRangerâ€™s outputs for each experiment:

1. **Whole resolution tissue image**. This will be segmented to obtain the cell boundaries that will be used to aggregate the transcript counts.
2. **tissue_positions.parquet**. This is the file that specifies the *2um* Visium HD bin locations relative to the full resolution image.
3. **filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5**. This is the .h5 file with the *2um* Visium HD bin counts.

## Defining ENACT Configurations
ENACT users can choose to specify the configurations via one of two ways:

1. Passing them within the class constructor:
```
  from enact.pipeline import ENACT

  so_hd = ENACT(
      cache_dir="/home/oneai/test_cache",

## Basic Example: Running ENACT from Notebook
The **[demo notebook](ENACT_demo.ipynb)** provides a step-by-step guide on how to install and run ENACT on VisiumHD public data using notebook. The **[output processing demo notebook](ENACT_outputs_demo.ipynb)** provides a comprehensive, step-by-step guide on how the user can use the generated data for further downstream analysis (see [Working with ENACT Output](#working-with-enact-output) for additional details)

## Basic Example: Running ENACT from Terminal
This section provides a guide for running ENACT on the [Human Colorectal Cancer sample](https://www.10xgenomics.com/datasets/visium-hd-cytassist-gene-expression-libraries-of-human-crc) provided on 10X Genomics' website.
### Step 1: Install ENACT from Source 
Refer to [Install ENACT from Source](#install-enact-from-source)

### Step 2: Download the necessary files from the 10X Genomics website:

1.  Whole slide image: full resolution tissue image
```
curl -O https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/spatial-exp/3.0.0/Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer/Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer_tissue_image.btf
```

2. Visium HD output file. The transcript counts are provided in a .tar.gz file that needs to be extracted:
```
curl -O https://cf.10xgenomics.com/samples/spatial-exp/3.0.0/Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer/Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer_binned_outputs.tar.gz
tar -xvzf Visium_HD_Human_Colon_Cancer_binned_outputs.tar.gz
```
Locate the following two files from the extracted outputs file.
```
.
â””â”€â”€ binned_outputs/
    â””â”€â”€ square_002um/
        â”œâ”€â”€ filtered_feature_bc_matrix.h5   <---- Transcript counts file (2um resolution)
        â””â”€â”€ spatial/
            â””â”€â”€ tissue_positions.parquet    <---- Bin locations relative to the full resolution image
```

To date, a limiting factor has been the resolution of sequencing based ST products. The introduction of the Visium High Definition (HD) technology opens the door to cell resolution ST studies. However, challenges remain in the ability to accurately map transcripts to cells and in assigning cell types based on the transcript data.We developed ENACT, a self-contained pipeline that integrates advanced cell segmentation with Visium HD transcriptomics data to infer cell types across whole tissue sections. Our pipeline incorporates novel bin-to-cell assignment methods, enhancing the accuracy of single-cell transcript estimates. Validated on diverse synthetic and real datasets, our approach is both scalableto samples with hundreds of thousands of cells and effective, offering a robust solution for spatially resolved transcriptomics analysis.ENACT source code is available at https://github.com/Sanofi-Public/enact-pipeline.
