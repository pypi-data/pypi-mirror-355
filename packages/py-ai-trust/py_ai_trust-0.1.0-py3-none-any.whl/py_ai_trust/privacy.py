        """
        Conducts a conceptual membership inference attack.
        This simplified version infers membership based on the model's confidence
        in its predictions for training vs. non-training data. Models tend to be
        more confident on data they've seen during training.

        A true membership inference attack (MIA) often involves training a shadow model
        or requires access to model logits/gradients and specific attack models.
        This implementation provides a basic heuristic using prediction confidence.

        Args:
            model (ClassifierMixin): The trained classifier model.
            X_train (Union[np.ndarray, pd.DataFrame]): Training features.
            y_train (np.ndarray): Training labels.
            X_test (Union[np.ndarray, pd.DataFrame]): Test/non-training features.
            y_test (np.ndarray): Test/non-training labels.
            confidence_threshold (float): Probability threshold above which a prediction
                                          is considered "high confidence".
            random_state (Optional[int]): Seed for reproducibility.
