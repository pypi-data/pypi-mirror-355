        The integrates series is a cumulative sum of the values of the series subtracted by the mean.

        mat_series (NDArray[np.float64]): Matrix of time series with one serie per column.
        axis (int): axis of the input_data matrix that contains the values for each time series
                    if the series are defined as rows, use axis=0, if the series are in the column, use axis=1.

        return_mean (bool): If an array containing the means of each series should be returned.
                    Defaults to False.

    Returns:
        NDArray[np.float64]: Matrix of integrated time series with one integrated time series per column.
        NDArray[np.float64]: Returned only if return_mean == True. Array with the mean value of each feature.
