  A lightweight, simple and specialized framework used for
  creating, storing, annotating and analyzing synthetic
  discussions between LLM users in the context of online
  discussions.


  This framework is designed for academic use, mainly for
  simulating Social Science experiments with multiple
  participants. It is finetuned for heavy server-side use
  and multi-day computations with limited resources. It has
  been tested on both simulated debates and online fora.
