    "# Creating and Managing Experiments\n",
    "\n",
    "The last two guides showcased how you can create and run synthetic discussions, and synthetic annotations using LLMs. However, in order to produce robust results for a hypothesis, you may need to produce multiple annotated discussions. \n",
    "\n",
    "While this is certainly possible using the `Discussion` and `Annotation` APIs, SynDisco offers the `Experiment` high-level API which automatically creates and manages multiple discussions with different configurations. An`Experiment` is an entity that generates and runs `jobs`. Thus, if we want to generate and run 100 `Discussion` jobs, we would use a `DiscussionExperiment`. Likewise, if we want to annotate those 100 discussions, we would use an `AnnotationExperiment`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This guide will showcase how you can leverage this API to automate your experiments. You will also learn how to utilize SynDisco's built-in logging functions as well as how to export your datasets in CSV format for convenience. "

    "While running a single discussion or annotation job may take a few minutes, running experiments composed of dozens or hundreds of synthetic discussions may take up to days. Thus, we need a mechanism to keep track of our experiments while they are running.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use SynDisco's `logging_util` module to log information about our experiments. This module performs the following functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Times the execution of computationally intensive jobs (such as synthetic discussions and annotations)\n",
    "* Provides details about the currently running jobs (e.g. selected configurations, participants, prompts etc.)\n",
    "* Displays warnings and errors to the user\n",
    "* Creates and continually updates log files\n",
    "\n",
    "Each object in SynDisco is internally assigned a Logger. You can use the `logging_util.logging_setup` function to update all of the internal loggers to follow your configuration. An example of this can be seen below:"
