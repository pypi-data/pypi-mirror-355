## Overview


DaMPly (Data Management Plan) is a Python module designed to streamline the process of managing and packaging directories.

This tool is particularly useful for archiving project directories while leaving behind a README file to provide context and instructions for future users.

## Features

View a project's `README`, with emphasized fields that follow the Data Management Plan (DMP) guidelines.

TODO
- [ ] README Check: Verifies the presence of a README file in the specified directory.
- [ ] User Interaction: Prompts the user for necessary information to enhance the archiving process.
- [ ] Directory Compression: Compresses all files and sub


## Development

This project uses [`pixi`](pixi.sh) for managing the development environment.
A set of convenient `tasks` are defined in the `pyproject.toml` file to streamline the development process.

The `build` feature contains the following tasks:

- `build`: Builds the package.
- `publish-pypi`: Publishes the package to the main PYPI repository.
- `publish-test`: Publishes the package to the TEST-PYPI repository.

For more details, view the [devnotes on pixi + hatch](devnotes/pixi-hatch-build.md).
