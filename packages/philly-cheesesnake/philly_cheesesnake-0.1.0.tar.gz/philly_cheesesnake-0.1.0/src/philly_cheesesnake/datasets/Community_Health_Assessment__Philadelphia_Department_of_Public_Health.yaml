notes: The Community Health Assessment (CHA) is a systematic assessment of population
  health in Philadelphia, highlighting key public health challenges and assets and
  informing local public health programs, policies, and partnerships. The CHA includes
  indicators reflecting health behaviors, health conditions, health care factors,
  and social and environmental determinants of health. The Philadelphia Department
  of Public Health publishes an annual report of the analyses, linked to under the
  'Related' tab. Additionally, they have released an online, interactive version of
  the CHA, known as the Community Health Explorer, to make the data more accessible
  to a broader audience.
