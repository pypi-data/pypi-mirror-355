notes: A digital soil survey and generally is the most detailed level of soil geographic
  data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The dataset consists of
  geo-referenced digital maps and attribute data, and it includes an optional special
  soil features map layer for features too small to delineate at the mapping scale
  but large and contrasting enough to significantly influence land use and management.
  The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System
  relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils
  and their properties.
