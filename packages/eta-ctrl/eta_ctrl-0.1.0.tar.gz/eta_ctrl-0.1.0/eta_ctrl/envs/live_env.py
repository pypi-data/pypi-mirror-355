            This function always returns 0 reward. Therefore, it must be extended if it is to be used with reinforcement

              Observations is a np.array() (numpy array) with floating point or integer values.
            * **reward**: The value of the reward function. This is just one floating point value.
            * **terminated**: Boolean value specifying whether an episode has been completed. If this is set to true,

              Typically, this is a timelimit, but could also be used to indicate an agent physically going out of
