### Centering the skeleton root
To center the skeleton root and set its position to (0,0,0) on a specific frame, provide the number of the frame you want the root to be centered in. This means that in the frame that you provide, the root will be in (0,0,0) and all the animation will be shifted accordingly. Useful to center any animation in frame 0 (Default frame = 0).

```python
from bvhTools.bvhManipulation import centerSkeletonRoot

centeredBvhRoot = centerSkeletonRoot(bvhData)
centeredBvhRoot = centerSkeletonRoot(bvhData, 42) # center at frame 42
```

### Centering the skeleton feet
This centers the whole skeleton in the X and Z axes for a specific frame, and it also centers it on the Y axis, to put the feet on Y = 0. In other words, the skeleton will be standing on (0,0,0) on the provided frame. It uses the two feet to calculate the average Y height, so the names of both feet joints are needed. (Default leftFootName = "LeftFoot", rightFootName = "RightFoot"). Useful to center the feet of any animation in frame 0 (Default frame = 0).

```python
from bvhTools.bvhManipulation import centerSkeletonFeet

centeredBvhRoot = centerSkeletonFeet(bvhData)
centeredBvhRoot = centerSkeletonFeet(bvhData, leftFootName = "lFoot", rightFootName = "rFoot", frame = 42) # center at frame 42 using custom left and right foot names
```

### Centering the skeleton on the X and Z axes
This centers the whole skeleton without changing the height of the animation. By default, it centers on the (0,0) on frame 0, but the frame can be specified.

```python
from bvhTools.bvhManipulation import centerSkeletonXZ

centeredBvh = centerSkeletonXZ(bvhData)
```

### Centering the skeleton around a specific joint
This centers the skeleton around a specific joint at a specific frame. In short, the selected joint will be on (0,0,0) at the specified frame.

```python
from bvhTools.bvhManipulation import centerSkeletonAroundJoint

centeredBvh = centerSkeletonAroundJoint(bvhData, "RightArm", 0) # The RightArm joint will be at (0,0,0) at frame 0
```

### Moving the skeleton around (adding an offset to the animation)
This shifts the enitre animation by adding a position offset to the root in every frame. The method uses the [X, Y, Z] convention where Y is the vertical axis.

```python
from bvhTools.bvhManipulation import moveSkeleton

movedData = moveSkeleton(bvhData, [5, 5, 0]) # Move the whole animation 5 units in the X axis and 5 units in the y axis
```

### Rotating the BVH in world coords
You can rotate the BVH around the world center. The method uses the [X, Y, Z] convention where Y is the vertical axis.

```python
from bvhTools.bvhManipulation import rotateSkeletonWorld

rotatedBvh = rotateSkeletonWorld(bvhData, [0, 90, 0]) # The new motion will be rotated around the vertical Y axis. 
```

### Rotating the BVH in local coords
You can rotate the BVH around the center of the root at whatever frame you choose (default = 0). The method uses the [X, Y, Z] convention, where Y is the vertical axis.

```python
from bvhTools.bvhManipulation import rotateSkeletonLocal

rotatedBvh = rotateSkeletonLocal(bvhData, [0, 90, 0]) # The new motion will be rotated around the vertical Y axis around the root joint position at frame 0.
```
