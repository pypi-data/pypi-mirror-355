# ðŸš€ Quick Fix for PyPI Upload

## The Problem
You're getting a 403 Forbidden error because:
1. **TestPyPI requires a separate account and token** (different from regular PyPI)
2. **You were uploading multiple versions** (now fixed)

## The Solution

### Step 1: Create TestPyPI Account
1. Go to: https://test.pypi.org/account/register/
2. Create a **new account** (separate from PyPI)
3. Verify your email

### Step 2: Get TestPyPI Token
1. Go to: https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/token/
2. Create a new API token
3. Copy the **full token** (including `pypi-` prefix)

### Step 3: Upload with Direct Token
Instead of using `.pypirc`, use the direct method:

```bash
cd velaris_csm_access_kit

uv run twine upload --repository testpypi \
  --username __token__ \
  --password pypi-YOUR_TESTPYPI_TOKEN_HERE \
  dist/*
```

Replace `pypi-YOUR_TESTPYPI_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual TestPyPI token.

### Step 4: Test Installation
After successful upload:
```bash
# In a new directory
uv add --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ velaris-csm-access-kit
```

## âœ… Current Status
- âœ… Package structure is correct
- âœ… Build files cleaned and rebuilt
- âœ… Only current version in dist/ folder
- âœ… Ready for upload once you have TestPyPI token

## Next Steps
1. Create TestPyPI account and token
2. Upload using the direct token method above
3. Test installation from TestPyPI
4. Then upload to production PyPI

Your package is ready - you just need the correct TestPyPI credentials! ðŸŽ‰
