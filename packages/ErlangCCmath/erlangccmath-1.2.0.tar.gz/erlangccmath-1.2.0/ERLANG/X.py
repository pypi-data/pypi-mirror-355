    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    Forecast : float
        The average number of arrivals per unit of time. (Forecast ≥ 0)
    AHT : float
        The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0)
    Agents : float
        Represents the number of agents; it can be real. (Agents ≥ 0)
    Awt : float
        The Acceptable Waiting Time is the maximum allowed waiting time.
        Customers that wait shorter than the Awt have received, per definition,
        a good service. The service level is defined as the percentage of 
        customers that are served within the Awt. The time unit is the same as 
        the others and, hence, is not necessarily in seconds! (Awt ≥ 0)
    Lines : int
        The Lines parameter is the limit on the total number of customers that 
        can be in the system at the same time, consisting of: lines in use by 
        customers in service, and lines in use by customers that wait. A new 
        arriving customer will be blocked if all lines are occupied. 
        (Lines ≥ Agents, integer). 
        Note: setting a default of 5* your top interval arrival # is good 
        practice, but remember it’s really about the capacity your company has 
        bought from the telephony provider.
    Patience : float
        The average time a customer is willing to wait in the queue. A simple 
        estimator for the patience is calculated by dividing the total waiting 
        time (including the waiting times of the abandoned customers) by the 
        number of abandonments. It is important to filter out extreme values 
        in advance. (Patience ≥ 0)
    Retrials : float
        The probability that a customer who abandons, redials. (0 ≤ Retrials ≤ 1)
    Definition : int
        A flag to switch between different modes of calculating the service level. 
        0 = virtual service level; 1 = answered; 2 = offered (default).
    Variance : float
        The variance of the forecast. All models take fluctuations in the number of 
        arrivals into account. This is characterized by the Poisson distribution, 
        for which the variance is equal to the expectation. The Variance parameter 
        can be used in case the variance is bigger than the expectation. 
        (Variance ≥ Forecast)
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The expected service level.

        Parameters
        ----------
        W : float
            The Average Speed of Answer (also known as average waiting time) is the time
            that an arbitrary customer with infinite patience would incur. (W > 0)
        Forecast : float
            The average number of arrivals per unit of time. (Forecast ≥ 0)
        AHT:AHT : list
            The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0). The difference between 
            this and the previous AHT parameter is that the AHT should be a range 
            of cells instead of a single number. The number of elements in the range
            determines the maximum number of concurrent chats that an agent can do. 
            This parameter is exclusively used in the Chat functions.
        Lines : int
            The Lines parameter is the limit on the total number of customers that 
            can be in the system at the same time, consisting of: lines in use by 
            customers in service, and lines in use by customers that wait. A new

            practice, but remember it’s really about the capacity your company has 
            bought from the telephony provider.
        Patience : float
            The average time a customer is willing to wait in the queue. A simple 
            estimator for the patience is calculated by dividing the total waiting 
            time (including the waiting times of the abandoned customers) by the

class ABANDON():
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    Forecast : float
        The average number of arrivals per unit of time. (Forecast ≥ 0)
    AHT : float
        The Average Handling Time of a call. (AHT > 0)
    Agents : float
        Represents the number of agents; it can be real. (Agents ≥ 0)
    Lines : int
        The Lines parameter is the limit on the total number of customers that 
        can be in the system at the same time, consisting of: lines in use by 
        customers in service, and lines in use by customers that wait. A new 
        arriving customer will be blocked if all lines are occupied. 
        (Lines ≥ Agents, integer). 
        Note: setting a default of 5* your top interval arrival # is good 
        practice, but remember it’s really about the capacity your company has 
        bought from the telephony provider.
    Patience : float
        The average time a customer is willing to wait in the queue. A simple 
        estimator for the patience is calculated by dividing the total waiting 
        time (including the waiting times of the abandoned customers) by the 
        number of abandonments. It is important to filter out extreme values 
        in advance. (Patience ≥ 0)
    Retrials : float
        The probability that a customer who abandons, redials. (0 ≤ Retrials ≤ 1)
    Variance : float
        The variance of the forecast. All models take fluctuations in the number of 
        arrivals into account. This is characterized by the Poisson distribution, 
        for which the variance is equal to the expectation. The Variance parameter 
        can be used in case the variance is bigger than the expectation. 
        (Variance ≥ Forecast)
    
    Returns
    -------
    float
        The fraction of customers that abandon.
