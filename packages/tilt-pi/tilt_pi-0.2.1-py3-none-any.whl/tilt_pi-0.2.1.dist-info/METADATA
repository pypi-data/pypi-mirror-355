# tilt-pi

A Python client for interacting with the Tilt Pi API.

This library provides a Python interface to the Tilt Pi, allowing you to retrieve data from Tilt
Hydrometers connected to it.

The Tilt Pi is a Raspberry Pi-based device that can read data from Tilt Hydrometers and broadcast it
over the network. The Tilt Pi can be used to monitor the fermentation of beer, wine, cider, and
other beverages.

The benefit of the Tilt Pi is that it can be placed in a location with better reception than the
Tilt Hydrometer itself, allowing for more reliable data collection.
