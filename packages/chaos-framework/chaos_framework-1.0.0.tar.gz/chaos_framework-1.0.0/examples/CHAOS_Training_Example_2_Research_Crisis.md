## Key Differentiators in This Example

### 1. **Ethical Complexity**
Unlike technical problems, this involves moral decisions about using others' code, presenting partial results, and academic integrity.

### 2. **Human Drama**
The quitting researcher, confused advisor, and institutional pressures add realistic human elements.

### 3. **Time Pressure Psychology**
The confidence trajectory and stress levels show how extreme deadlines affect decision-making.

### 4. **Academic-Specific Chaos**
Self-citation detection, LaTeX mysteries, and conference politics represent domain-specific challenges.

### 5. **Hidden Tool Powers**
Emergency modes and undocumented features become crucial - showing the value of deep tool knowledge.

### 6. **Ethical Navigation**
Each decision includes moral considerations, showing how agents must balance efficiency with integrity.

This example demonstrates that the CHAOS framework can handle not just technical problems but complex human situations requiring judgment, ethics, and creativity under extreme pressure.
