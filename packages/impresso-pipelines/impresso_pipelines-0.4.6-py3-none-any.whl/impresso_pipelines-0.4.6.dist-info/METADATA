# Python Package: [impresso-pipelines]

## Overview
This repository contains a Python package designed for efficient and modular processing. Currently, it includes the following subpackages:

- **Language Identification Pipeline**: Detects the language of input text and provides a corresponding probability score.
- **OCR QA Pipeline**: Evaluates the quality of OCR-processed text by calculating a score (0-1) representing the proportion of recognized words in the input text using a language-specific, efficient Bloom filter database.
- **LDA Topic Modeling Pipeline**: Uses topic modelling to assign the most relevant topics to the input text. 



## Installation
To install the package with all subpackages, use:
```bash
pip install impresso_pipelines[all]
```

To install individual subpackages without any additional dependencies, use:
```bash
pip install impresso_pipelines[langident]   # Language Identification
pip install impresso_pipelines[ocrqa]       # OCR QA
pip install impresso_pipelines[ldatopics]   # LDA Topics
```

## Usage
Import and use the subpackages as follows:
```python
from impresso_pipelines.langident import LangIdentPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ocrqa import OCRQAPipeline
from impresso_pipelines.ldatopics import LDATopicsPipeline
```

## Running the Pipeline examples
For usage examples, refer to the individual README files:

 - [Langident Pipeline](README_langident.md)
 - [OCR QA Pipeline](README_ocrqa.md)
 - [LDA Topics Pipeline](README_ldatopics.md)



Additional examples are available in the documentation notebooks:
 - [langident_pipeline_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/impresso/impresso-datalab-notebooks/tree/main/annotate/langident_pipeline_demo.ipynb)
 - [ocrqa_pipeline_demo.ipynb](https://github.com/impresso/impresso-datalab-notebooks/tree/main/annotate/ocrqa_pipeline_demo.ipynb).

## Future Plans
More Impresso functionality (newsagency detection, named entity recognition and linking) will be added to enhance functionality and broaden use cases.
