# Imantodes

**Imantodes** ("i-MAN-toe-dees"): light-weight Python code for creating new interactive scientific visualization programs. Taxonomically, [Imantodes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imantodes) is a genus of thin (i.e. _light-weight_) snakes (_pythons_ are snakes) with large eyes that help them see well at night (like how _visualization_ tools help you see things that are otherwise hidden).

Imantodes is being created at the University of Chicago, in fits and starts over many years, leading up to more focused development in summer 2025. The main author is [Gordon Kindlmann](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~glk/), though some sections have been primarily written by students ...

The code has not yet stabilized enough for a versioned release.
