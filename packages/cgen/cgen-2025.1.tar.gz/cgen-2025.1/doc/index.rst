Welcome to cgen's documentation!
==================================

cgen offers a simple abstract syntax tree for C and related languages
(C++/CUDA/OpenCL) to allow structured code generation from Python.

Here's an example, to give you an impression:

.. literalinclude:: ../examples/hello-cgen.py

This prints the following::

    char const *greet()
    {
      return "hello world";
    }

:mod:`cgen` deliberately does not worry about expression trees. Its sister
package :mod:`pymbolic` can help you build those.
