# Data mixing

This folder provides a couple of examples for how to mix different datasets using our `mix_datasets` API in the file [example_mixing.py](example_mixing.py). The `mix_datasets` API requires writing recipe yaml files, and you'll find a couple of those in here as well that are used by the examples. Each recipe yaml has comments at the top of the file explaining what the recipe does.

For a more general overview of what data mixing is, see [data_mixing.md](../../data_mixing.md).
