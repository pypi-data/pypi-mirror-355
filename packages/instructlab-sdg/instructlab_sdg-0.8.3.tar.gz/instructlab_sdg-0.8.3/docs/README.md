# Docs

The markdown files directly within this folder are more in-depth documentation about the SDG library.

The [examples/](examples) folder contains multiple examples demonstrating how to use different parts of SDG, and is a good resource to see how some things can be accomplished that may not be explicitly documented elsewhere.
