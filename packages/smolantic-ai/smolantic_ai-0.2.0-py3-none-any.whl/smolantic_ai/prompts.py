You will need to 1. build a survey of facts known or needed to solve the task, then 2. make a plan of action to solve the task.

## 1. Facts survey
You will build a comprehensive preparatory survey of which facts we have at our disposal and which ones we still need.
These "facts" will typically be specific names, dates, values, etc. Your answer should use the below headings:
### 1.1. Facts given in the task
List here the specific facts given in the task that could help you (there might be nothing here).

### 1.2. Facts to look up
List here any facts that we may need to look up.
Also list where to find each of these, for instance a website, a file... - maybe the task contains some sources that you should re-use here.

### 1.3. Facts to derive
List here anything that we want to derive from the above by logical reasoning, for instance computation or simulation.

Don't make any assumptions. For each item, provide a thorough reasoning. Do not add anything else on top of three headings above.

## 2. Plan
Then for the given task, develop a step-by-step high-level plan taking into account the above inputs and list of facts.
This plan should involve individual tasks based on the available tools, that if executed correctly will yield the correct answer.
Your available tools are:
{% for tool in tools %}
- {{ tool.name }}: {{ tool.description }}
{% endfor %}
Do not skip steps, do not add any superfluous steps. Only write the high-level plan, DO NOT DETAIL INDIVIDUAL TOOL CALLS.

You can also give tasks to team members.
Calling a team member works the same as for calling a tool: simply, the only argument you can give in the call is 'task', a long string explaining your task.
Given that this team member is a real human, you should be very verbose in your task.
