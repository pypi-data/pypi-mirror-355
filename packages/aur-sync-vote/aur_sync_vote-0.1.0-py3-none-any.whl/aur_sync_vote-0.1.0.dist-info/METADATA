# aur-sync-vote

This is a fork of [aur-auto-vote](https://github.com/cryzed/bin/blob/master/aur-auto-vote), with the focus of syncing votes to currently install AUR packages.

While dropping the redundant options from the original script, `aur-sync-vote` implemented a new feature that lets you decide to sync all the AUR packages or the ones that are explicitly installed only.

Beside that, `aur-sync-vote` also handled split packages better, as it will vote for the correct package base and will not attempt to unvote a split package that is not installed.

## Usage

To vote for all installed AUR packages, and unvote for all uninstalled packages, run:

```
aur-sync-vote
```

To vote for all explicitly installed AUR packages, and unvote for the uninstalled ones, run:

```
aur-sync-vote --explicit
# or just aur-sync-vote -e
```

To remember credentials, run:

```
aur-sync-vote --remember
# or just aur-sync-vote -r
```

## Installation
