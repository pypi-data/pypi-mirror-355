PyAutoPlot is an open-source Python library designed to make dataset analysis much easier by generating helpful detailed plots using `matplotlib`. It automatically generates appropriate plots based on the dataset you feed it.

### Changes in version 1.0.2:
Bug Fixes and Robustness:
- Corrected calculation of missing values in `_generate_analysis`.
- Added error handling for statistical functions (`skewness`, `kurtosis`, `autocorrelation`) to prevent crashes with empty or zero-variance data, returning NaN instead.
- Added warnings for columns not classified by `_detect_column_types`.
- Included input validation in the `plot()` method to check for valid column names and required arguments, raising ValueErrors for invalid input.

Performance Enhancements:
- Modified `auto_plot()` to display and close plot figures section by section (or individually for looped plots like pie/line charts). This significantly reduces memory consumption when generating many plots.
- Added a warning in the `auto_plot()` docstring regarding potential performance issues of pairwise scatter plots with many numeric columns.

Code Cleanup:
- Refined static method definitions (`_calculate_skewness`, `_calculate_kurtosis`, etc.) by removing unnecessary `self` arguments and ensuring calls are updated.

- Testing:
- Replaced the existing `test.py` with a new script that:
    - Creates a `test_output` directory for plot outputs.
    - Uses `energy_consumption_dataset.csv` (with a dummy fallback).
    - Demonstrates `AutoPlot` initialization.
    - Runs `auto_plot()` with default and custom configurations.
    - Runs manual `plot()` for scatter, distribution, boxplot, and bar types.
    - Shows usage of the `customize()` method.
    - Includes a test with a small, inline dataset.
    - Saves all generated plots for visual inspection.

### Changes in version 1.0.1:
- Added package dependencies to PyAutoPlot: `matplotlib>=3.0.0`, `pandas>=1.0.0`, and `numpy>=1.18.0`.

### Changes in version 1.0.0:
- `AutoPlot` class, along with `auto_plot` and `plot` functions. `auto_plot` automatically generates suitable plots based on values in your dataset.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The `AutoPlot` object needs to be initialized with a **CSV dataset** before any plots can be generated using either `plot` or `auto_plot`.

## Installation

You can install PyAutoPlot using pip:

```bash
pip install pyautoplot
```

## Supported Python Versions

PyAutoPlot supports the following Python versions:

- Python 3.6
- Python 3.7
- Python 3.8
- Python 3.9
- Python 3.10
- Python 3.11/Later (Preferred)

Please ensure that you have one of these Python versions installed before using PyAutoPlot. PyAutoPlot may not work as expected on lower versions of Python than the supported.

## Features

- **Automatic Plotting**: PyAutoPlot automatically generates appropriate plots based on values present in your dataset. Currently, PyAutoPlot supports the following types of data: `numeric`, `categorical`, and `time-series`.
- **Customization**: Due to matplotlib's high customizability, you can create and use custom themes for PyAutoPlot, just pass in your theme as a dictionary of RCParams (See `plot.rcParams.keys()` for a list of valid parameters) or choose from our predefined themes. You can also pass in additional parameters to the function that `matplotlib` can recognize (e.g. `color='#5d17eb'`).

## Usage

### AutoPlot

```python
from pyautoplot import AutoPlot

# Initialize with a CSV file
plotter = AutoPlot("path/to/dataset.csv")

# Automatically analyze and plot
plotter.auto_plot(output_file='test', theme="dark", color='orange', excludes=['detailed_analysis'])
```

> [!NOTE]
> PyAutoPlot may not work well with certain datasets. If you find any issues please open an issue.

### Customization

```python
from pyautoplot import AutoPlot

# Define your custom theme
custom_theme = {
    "axes.facecolor": "#ffffff",
    "axes.edgecolor": "#000000",
    "axes.labelcolor": "#000000",
    "figure.facecolor": "#ffffff",
    "grid.color": "#dddddd",
    "text.color": "#000000",
    "xtick.color": "#000000",
    "ytick.color": "#000000",
    "legend.frameon": True,
}

# Initialize with a CSV file
plotter = AutoPlot("path/to/dataset.csv")

# Automatically analyze and plot using the custom theme
plotter.auto_plot(output_file='test', theme=custom_theme, color='orange', excludes=['detailed_analysis'])
```
