## 🎯 What Goes in This Folder?

This is your **special place** to drop all the precious files that make your Gradio apps amazing! 🌟

### 📦 Common Files You Might Drop Here:

- **📄 `requirements.txt`** - Your app's dependencies

### 🧙‍♂️ How the Wizard Uses This Folder:

When you use our **deployment wizard**, it will:
1. 🔍 **Scan this folder** for requirements.txt and other useful files
2. 📋 **Ask if you want to include** any of these files in your deployment
3. 🚀 **Automatically configure** your Modal deployment to use them
4. 💚 **Style everything** in beautiful Modal green!

### 📝 Example Structure:

```
drop-ur-precious-stuff-here/
├── requirements.txt         # 📦 Your dependencies
├── assets/
│   ├── logo.png            # 🖼️ Your app logo
│   └── background.jpg      # 🎨 Background image
├── models/

├── data/
│   └── sample_data.csv     # 📊 Sample data
└── config/

```

### 🎉 Pro Tips:

- **🗂️ Organize files** in subfolders for easy management
- **📝 Use descriptive names** so the wizard can understand them
- **🔒 Keep secrets secure** - don't commit sensitive files to git
- **📏 Check file sizes** - Modal has limits on deployment size
- **✅ Test locally first** before deploying to Modal
