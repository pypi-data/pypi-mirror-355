"""
This module defines the `XmlValidator` class â€” a Robot Framework test 
library for validating XML files against XSD schemas using the 
`xmlschema` library.

The validator supports both individual and batch validation workflows, 
with comprehensive error reporting and optional export to structured 
CSV files.

Key Features:

- Validation of a single XML file against a specified schema.
- Batch validation of multiple XML files in a folder, using:
  - A single shared schema.
  - Dynamic schema matching by namespace or file name.
- Detailed error reporting for validation failures.
- Namespace-aware validation for strict conformance.
- Graceful handling of malformed XML or XSD files.
- Optional export of all collected errors to a CSV file.

This module is intended to be imported by Robot Framework test suites 
or executed as a Python module via a direct call.

@library(scope='GLOBAL')
class XmlValidator:
    """
    XmlValidator is a `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org/>`_ 
    test library for validating XML files against XSD schemas.

    The library leverages the power of the 
    `xmlschema library <https://pypi.org/project/xmlschema/>`_ and is 
    designed for both single-file and batch XML validation workflows.

    It provides structured and detailed reporting of XML parse errors 
    (malformed XML content) and XSD violations, schema auto-detection 
    and CSV exports of collected errors.

    Features are described in detail on the `project repo's landing page. 
    <https://github.com/MichaelHallik/robotframework-xmlvalidator>`_.

    **Overview**
    
    The main keyword is ``Validate Xml Files``.
    
    The other keywords are convenience/helper functions, e.g. ``Reset 
    Error Facets``.

    The ``Validate Xml Files`` validates one or more XML files against 
    one or more XSD schema files and collects and reports all 
    encountered errors.

    The type of error that the keyword can detect is not limited to XSD 
    violations, but may also pertain to malformed XML files (e.g. parse 
    errors), empty files, unmatched XML files (no XSD match found) and 
    others.

    Errors that result from malformed XML files or from XSD violations 
    support detailed error reporting. Using the ``error_facets`` 
    argument you may specify the details the keyword should collect and 
    report about captured errors.

    When operating in batch mode, the ``Validate Xml Files`` keyword 
    always validates the entire set of passed XML files. That is, when 
    it encounters an error in a file, it does not simply then fail.
    Rather, it collects the error details (as determined by the 
    error_facets arg) and then continues validating the current file as 
    well as any subsequent file(s).

    In that fashion the keyword works through the entire set of files.

    When having finished checking the last file, it will log a summary 
    of the test run and then proceed to report all collected errors in 
    the console, in the RF log and, optionally, in the form of a CSV 
    file.

    **Batch mode & dynamic XSD matching**

    The ``Validate Xml Files`` keyword supports validating a single, 
    individual XML file against an XSD schema. It also supports batch 
    flows, by being able to validate multiple XML files in a specified 
    folder against one or more XSD schema files. These XSD files may 
    either reside in the same folder (as the XML files) or in a 
    different folder.
    
    In the latter case (i.e. when multiple schema files are 
    involved) XML files are matched dynamically to XSD files, supporting 
    either a 'by filename' strategy or a 'by namespace strategy'.

    That means you can simply pass the paths to a folder containing 
    XML files and to a folder containing XSD files and the library 
    will determine which XSD schema file to use for each XML file. 

    If the XML and XSD files reside in the same folder, you only 
    have to pass one folder path and the library will dynamically pair 
    each XML file with the relevant XSD schema file. 
    
    When no matching XSD schema could be identified for an XML file, 
    this will be integrated into the error reporting (the keyword will 
    not fail).

    As mentioned earlier, you may also refer to specific XML/XSD files 
    (instead of to folders). In that case, no matching will be 
    attempted, but the library will simply try to validate the specified 
    XML file against the specified XSD file.

    **Schema pre-loading**

    The library supports loading a schema by specifying an ``xsd_path`` 
    when importing the library in a Robot Framework test suite. The 
    preloaded schema is then reused for all validations until 
    overridden at the test case level. 

    **Comprehensive, robust and flexible error reporting**

    - Captures XSD schema violations.

     - Missing required elements.
     - Cardinality constraints.
     - Datatype mismatches (e.g., invalid `xs:dateTime`).
     - Pattern and enumeration violations.
     - Namespace errors.
     - Etc.

    - Captures malformed XML (e.g. missing closing tag, encoding 
      issues).
    - Handles edge cases like empty files or XML files that could not be 
      matched to an XSD schema file.
    - Does not immediately fail on errors, but collects encountered all 
      errors in all files and reports them in a structured format in the 
      console and RF log. Only *then* fails (assuming one or more 
      errors have been collected).
    - Supports specifying the details that should be collected for 
      encountered errors.
    - Optionally exports the error report to a CSV file, providing the 
      file name next to all error details for traceability.
    
    **Customizing error collection**

    Use the ``error_facets`` argument to control which attributes of 
    detected errors will be collected and reported. E.g. the element 
    locator (XPath), error message, involved namespace and/or the XSD 
    validator that failed.

    Error facets can be set by passing a list of one or more error 
    facets, either with the library import and/or on the test case 
    level (i.e. when calling the ``Validate XML Files`` keyword).

    These are the facets (or attributes) that can be collected and 
    reported for each encountered error:

    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Facet         | Description                                                                |
    +===============+============================================================================+
    | ``message``   | A human-readable message describing the validation error.                  |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``path``      | The XPath location of the error in the XML document.                       |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``domain``    | The domain of the error (e.g., "validation").                              |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``reason``    | The reason for the error, often linked to XSD constraint violations.       |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``validator`` | The XSD component (e.g., element, attribute, type) that failed validation. |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``schema_path`` | The XPath location of the error in the XSD schema.                       |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``namespaces`` | The namespaces involved in the error (if applicable).                     |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``elem``      | The XML element that caused the error (``ElementTree.Element``).           |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``value``     | The invalid value that triggered the error.                                |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``severity``  | The severity level of the error (not always present).                      |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ``args``      | The arguments passed to the error message formatting.                      |
    +---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------+

    For each error that is encountered, the selected error facet(s) will 
    be collected and reported.

    Error facets passed during library initialization will be overruled 
    by error facets that are passed at the test case level, when calling 
    the ``Validate Xml Files`` keyword.

    The values you can pass through the `error_facets` argument are 
    based on the attributes of the error objects as returned by the 
    XMLSchema.iter_errors() method, that is provided by the xmlschema 
    library and the the xmlvalidator library leverages. Said method 
    yields instances of 
    xmlschema.validators.exceptions.XMLSchemaValidationError (or its 
    subclasses), each representing a specific validation issue 
    encountered in an XML file. These error objects expose various 
    attributes that describe the nature, location, and cause of the 
    problem.

    The table lists the most commonly available attributes, though 
    additional fields may be available depending on the type of 
    validation error.

    **Support for XSD includes/imports**

    Enables resolution of schema imports/includes via a custom base URL, 
    via the ``base_url`` arg.

    Use ``base_url`` when your XSD uses ``<xs:include>`` or ``<xs:import>``
    with relative paths.

    You can pass ``base_url`` with the library import (together with 
    passing ``xsd_path``) and/or when calling ``Validate Xml Files`` 
    with ``xsd_path``.

    **Basic usage examples**

    For a comprehensive set of example test cases, please see the 
    `Robot Framework integration tests <https://github.com/MichaelHallik/robotframework-xmlvalidator/tree/main/test/integration/>`_ 
    in the projects GitHub repository.

    The repo contains a 
    `structured overview of all implemented tests <https://github.com/MichaelHallik/robotframework-xmlvalidator/blob/main/test/_doc/integration/overview.html>`_
    per topic (e.g. library import, schema matching strategies, etc.).

    It further contains a detailed instruction on 
    `how to run Robot Framework tests <https://github.com/MichaelHallik/robotframework-xmlvalidator/blob/main/test/_doc/integration/README.md>`_.

    Finally, the repo also contains a `demo test suite file <https://github.com/MichaelHallik/robotframework-xmlvalidator/blob/main/test/demo/demo.robot>`_ containing 
    eight self-contained test cases to demonstrates the following features:
    
    - Single and batch XML validation
    - Schema matching by filename and namespace
    - Custom error facets
    - Malformed XML handling
    - XSD includes/imports
    - CSV export

    A test suite file may look like the following:

        All arguments are optional.

        ``xsd_path``

        Must be a (valid) path to a single XSD file. If the path 
        points to a directory, to a file without '.xsd' extension or 
        to an invalid or corrupt XSD file, an appropriate exception 
        will be raised.

        The optional ``xsd_path`` parameter allows pre-loading a 
        specific XSD schema file during initialization. This schema 
        will then be used as the schema for all subsequent calls to 
        ``Validate Xml Files`` that do not themselves pass a path to 
        an XSD schema file or to a folder containing one or more XSD 
        files.
        
        As soon as an ``xsd_path`` (to a schema file or a folder 
        holding one or more schema files) is passed to 
        ``Validate Xml Files``, at the test case level, a schema 
        file that was loaded during library initialization will be 
        overriden.
        
        If no schema has been set during initialization, then a path 
        to an XSD schema file (or a folder holding one or more 
        schema files) must be supplied in the very first call to 
        ``Validate Xml Files`` to prevent the call from failing.

        If no schema has been set during library import or by a 
        precending call to ``Validate Xml Files``, then any call to 
        the keyword that does not provide a schema, will fail.

        Each time a schema file is passed and set, all subsequent calls 
        to ``Validate Xml Files`` will use that schema, unless it is 
        replaced by passing a new ``xsd_path`` with a call.

        ``base_url``

        The `base_url` parameter is used to resolve relative imports 
        and includes within the XSD schema. It should point to the 
        base directory or URL for resolving relative paths in the 
        XSD schema, such as imports and includes.

        ``error_facets``

        This parameter accepts a list of error attributes to collect 
        during validation failures. If not provided, it will be set to 
        the default: ['path', 'reason']. 
        
        Using ``error_facets`` you can control which attributes of 
        validation errors are to be collected and, ultimately, reported.
        
        See the introduction for more details on the purpose and usage 
        of error facets.

        ``fail_on_error``

        The ``fail_on_errors`` argument controls whether a test case 
        should fail if one or more XML validation errors are detected. 
        It defaults to True. A test case that has resulted in the 
        collection of one or more errors (of whatever type) will then 
        receive a status of FAIL.
        
        You can use the ``fail_on_errors`` argument to change this 
        default behaviour. When set to False, a test cases's status will 
        always be PASS, regardless whether errors were collected or not.

        This may be useful for:
        
        - Non-blocking checks in dashboards or QA reports.
        - Legacy or transitional systems where some invalid files are expected.
        - Schema discovery or diagnostics, where conformance isnâ€™t yet enforced.
        - Soft rollout of stricter validation rules, allowing time to adapt.

        Note that with ``fail_on_error=True`` the library's batch 
        validation behavior remains unchanged by the latter. That is, 
        fail_on_errors=True does not short-circuit the validation 
        process in any way.
        
        **Examples**

        Using a preloaded schema:

        .. code:: robotframework

            ************* Settings ***
                      Library    xmlvalidator    xsd_path=path/to/schema.xsd

        Defer schema loading to the test case(s):

        .. code:: robotframework

            **********Library    xmlvalidator

        Importing with preloaded XSD that requires a base_url:

        .. code:: robotframework

            **********Library    xmlvalidator    xsd_path=path/to/schema_with_include.xsd
            **********...                        base_url=path/to/include_schemas

        Use ``base_url`` when your XSD uses ``<xs:include>`` or ``<xs:import>`` with relative paths.

        Use the ``error_facets`` argument to control which attributes of detected errors will be collected and reported.

        E.g. the element locator (XPath), error message, involved namespace and/or the XSD validator that failed.

        Example:

        .. code:: robotframework

            **********Library    xmlvalidator    error_facets=path, message, validator

        You can also combine this with a preloaded schema and/or a base_url:

        .. code:: robotframework

            **********Library    xmlvalidator    xsd_path=schemas/schema.xsd
            **********...                        error_facets=value, namespaces

        For more examples see the project's 
        `Robot Framework integration test suite <https://github.com/MichaelHallik/robotframework-xmlvalidator/blob/main/test/integration/01_library_initialization.robot>`_.

        Constructs a mapping between XML files and the XSD schemas to 
        use for their validation.

        This internal method is used during batch validation workflows 
        to determine which XSD schema (if any) should be used for each 
        XML file in a given set.

        Depending on the presence of `xsd_path` and 
        `xsd_search_strategy`, it supports the following resolution 
        strategies:

        1. Single schema (shared across all XML files).
        
        If `xsd_path` resolves to a single XSD file, that schema is 
        preloaded and reused for all target XML files.

        2. Dynamic schema matching (multiple schemas):

        If `xsd_path` resolves to a directory with multiple `.xsd` 
        files, each XML file is matched to a corresponding schema file.

        There are two ways in which `xsd_path` can resolve to a 
        directory:

        - Either because the passed `xsd_path` is a directory.
        - Or because no `xsd_path` has been passed (hence it is None), 
          but a (valid) `xsd_search_strategy` has been passed. In that 
          case it is assumed that the passed `xml_paths` is a list 
          holding one item that points to a folder holding not only XML 
          files, but also their accompanying XSD files. That path will, 
          therefore, be assigned to `xsd_path` within the method.

        XML and XSD files can be matched by either one of these 
        strategies:

        - 'by_namespace' (DEFAULT):
           Matches XSDs based on XML namespace compatibility.
        - 'by_file_name':
           Matches XML and XSD files based on identical stem (base 
           name).

        3. Fallback to default schema:

        If neither `xsd_path` nor `xsd_search_strategy` is provided, the 
        method assumes a default schema has already been set on the 
        class instance (i.e. during library initialization).

        Args:

        - xml_paths (List[Path]):
          A list of resolved paths to XML files that need validation.
        - xsd_path (str | Path, optional):
          Either a path to a single `.xsd` file or a directory 
          containing multiple `.xsd` files. If not provided, fallback 
          behavior applies.
        - xsd_search_strategy (Literal["by_namespace", "by_file_name"], optional):
          Specifies how to dynamically map each XML file to a schema 
          when multiple `.xsd` files are present. Required when 
          `xsd_path` is a folder.
        - base_url (str, optional):
          An optional base path or URL used when resolving `import` or 
          `include` statements within XSD files.

        Returns:

        - Dict[Path, Path | None]:
          A dictionary mapping each XML file path to its corresponding 
          XSD schema path (or to None if the default schema should be 
          used).

        Raises:

        - SystemError:
          Raised if schema loading fails during single-schema or dynamic 
          resolution. The raised error includes parsing failure details.

        Notes:

        - If an XML file cannot be matched to a schema in dynamic 
          matching mode, a `FileNotFoundError` is mapped to that file 
          path in the return dictionary.
        - If a malformed XMl file is encountered, the resulting parse 
          error will be caught and mapped to the path of that file, in the 
          return dictionary.
        - This method does not perform validation â€” only resolution of 
          schema-to-XML associations.
        - The returned result is passed to `_validate_xml()` during 
          batch validation to apply the resolved schema to each XML.

        Ensures that a schema is available for validation.

        This internal method guarantees that the `XmlValidator` instance

        or whether one should be loaded from the provided `xsd_path`.

        If no `xsd_path` is given but a schema is already loaded (in

              and will typically be assigned to `self.schema`.

             namespace.
        2. by_file_name:

        path, with support for resolving relative paths via the 
        `base_url` parameter.

        If the parse/load attempt of a schema file results in any error

        Validates an XML file against the currently loaded or provided 
        XSD schema.

        This method performs the core XML validation logic and is 
        invoked by the public `validate_xml_file` method. It checks an 
        XML file for conformance with the structural and datatype rules 
        defined in the XSD schema.

        It focuses exclusively on validation and generating errors based 
        on the specified facets.

        Errors that are collected and returned can be categorized as 
        follows:

        1. XSD Schema violations.

        The following types of XSD schema violations are detected during 
        validation:

        1. Detects missing or extra elements that violate cardinality 
           rules, e.g.:
           - Verifies that all mandatory elements (minOccurs > 0) are 
             present in the XML.
           - Ensures that optional elements (minOccurs = 0) do not 
             exceed their maximum allowed occurrences (maxOccurs).

        2. Sequence and Order Violations:
           - Validates the order of child elements within a parent 
             element if the schema specifies a sequence model 
             (`<xsd:sequence>`).
           - Detects elements that are out of order or missing in a 
             sequence.

        3. Datatype Violations:
           - Ensures that element and attribute values conform to their 
             specified datatypes (e.g., xs:string, xs:integer, 
             xs:dateTime).
           - Identifies invalid formats, such as incorrect date or time 
             formats for xs:date and xs:dateTime.

        4. Pattern and Enumeration Violations:
           - Checks that values conform to patterns defined using 
             `<xsd:pattern>`.
           - Ensures that values fall within allowed enumerations 
             specified in the schema.

        5. Attribute Validation:
           - Verifies that required attributes are present.
           - Ensures that attribute values adhere to their declared 
             datatypes and constraints.

        6. Namespace Compliance:
           - Validates that elements and attributes belong to the 
             correct namespaces as defined in the schema.
           - Detects namespace mismatches or missing namespace 
             declarations.

        7. Group Model Violations:
           - Validates conformance with `<xsd:choice>` and `<xsd:all>` 
             group models, ensuring correct usage of child elements as 
             per the schema.

        8. Referential Constraints:
           - Checks for violations in `<xsd:key>`, `<xsd:keyref>`, and 
             `<xsd:unique>` constraints.

        9. Document Structure and Completeness:
           - Ensures that the XML document adheres to the hierarchical 
             structure defined by the schema.
           - Detects incomplete or improperly nested elements.

        10. General Schema Violations:
            - Detects schema-level issues, such as invalid imports or 
              includes, during schema compilation if they affect 
              validation.

        2. Errors following from malformed XML and/or XSD files.

          The method checks whether upstream handling of the involved 
          XML file (e.g. during dynamic schema matching) resulted in an 
          error. For instance a FileNotFound error or a ParseError.
          
          The method does this by checking whether the coresponding 
          xsd_file_path is an instance of BaseException. In that case, 
          the method returns early, propagating the error to the 
          downstream error collection & reporting.

          The method tself performs a additonal sanity check on the 
          involved XML/XSD files, calling the sanity_check_files() 
          utility method on both. The latter checks each file whether:

          - it exists
          - is not empty
          - is of the correct file type
          - is well-formed (syntactycally correct)
          
          In case of a failing check, the method returns early, 
          propagating the involved error to downstream error collection 
          & reporting.
        
        3. Invalid XSD schema.

           If schema loading fails, the method returns early, 
           propagating the involved error to downstream error collection 
           & reporting.

        Args:

        - xml_path (str or Path):
          Path to the XML file to validate.

        - xsd_path (str or Path, optional):
          Path to an alternative XSD schema file to use for this 
          validation. If not provided, the schema loaded during 
          initialization will be used.

        - error_facets (list, optional):
          Specifies which attributes of the XMLSchemaValidationError 
          should be included in the error output.
          This provides flexibility in tailoring the level of detail in 
          the error messages.

          Supported Attributes:

          add_note, args, elem, expected, get_elem_as_string, 
          get_obj_as_string, index, invalid_child, invalid_tag, 
          message, msg, namespaces, obj, occurs, origin_url, 
          particle, path, reason, root, schema_url, source, 
          sourceline, stack_trace, validator, with_traceback

          Defaults to ['path', 'reason'].

        Returns:

        - tuple (is_valid, errors):
          - is_valid (bool):
            True if the XML file conforms to the schema, False 
            otherwise.
          - errors (list of dict):
            A list of detailed error facets/aspects, each represented as  
            dictionary. The dictionary keys depend on the `error_facets` 
            argument.

        **Introduction**

        Please make sure to have read the ``Introduction`` to the 
        `keyword doc <https://github.com/MichaelHallik/robotframework-xmlvalidator/blob/main/docs/XmlValidator.html>`_.
        
        That section contains information that is essential to the 
        effective usage of the ``Validate Xml Files`` keyword and that 
        will not be repeated here, to avoid redundancy. 

        This keyword supports *single file* validation, *batch* validation 
        and *dynamic schema mapping*.

        It also supports comprehensive and *configurable* error reporting 
        and the *export* of all collected errors to CSV files.

        **Basic use cases**

        **Error collecting and reporting**       

        Validation errors fall into three main categories:

        - XSD violations:
         
         - Captures cardinality issues, datatype mismatches, enumeration 
           violations, pattern mismatches, namespace errors, etc.

        - Malformed XML:
         
         - Any syntax/parse issues.

        - File-level issues:        
         
         - Detects empty, non-existent, or .
         - Uses sanity checks to validate syntax and type before XSD validation.
        
        - Schema issues:
        
         - Handles cases of invalid, unreadable, or unmatchable schema files.

        All collected errors can optionally be written to a CSV file. 
        Each row includes error details and the associated file name.

        **Arguments**   

        ``xml_path``

        Path to an XML file or a directory containing `.xml` files.

        ``xsd_path``
        
        Path to a single `.xsd` file or a directory containing one or more 
        `.xsd` files. Required for dynamic schema resolution or schema 
        overrides. Defaults to None.

        ``xsd_search_strategy``

        Strategy for dynamic schema resolution when validating against 
        multiple schemas. Required if `xsd_path` is a directory or not 
        passed at all.
        
        Defaults to 'by_namespace'.

        ``base_url``
        
        Base directory for resolving schema imports and includes.
        Defaults to None.

        ``error_facets``
        
        List of error details/attributes to include in the collecting 
        and reporting of errors.

        Defaults to ['path', 'reason'].

        ``pre_parse``
        
        If True, performs well-formedness checks on all XML/XSD files 
        before schema validation. Defaults to True.

        ``write_to_csv``
        
        If True, writes all collected errors to a CSV file in the same 
        folder as the validated XML(s). Defaults to True.

        ``timestamped``
        
        Appends a timestamp to the CSV filename for uniqueness.
        Defaults to True.

        ``reset_errors``
        
        Clears previously stored validation results before this run.
        Defaults to True.

        ``fail_on_errors``

        Fails a test cases if, after checking the entire batch of one or 
        XML files, one or more errors have been reported. Error 
        reporting and exporting will not change.

        **Returns**

        A tuple, holding:

          - A list of dictionaries:
            A list of all validation errors found during the run. Each 
            error is a dictionary with items that are based on the 
            `error_facets`.
          - A string or None:
            The path to the generated CSV file if there are errors and 
            `write_to_csv=True`; otherwise None.

        **Raises**

        Since the keyword's purpose is to catch and collect various 
        types of errors, for these errors no exceptions will be raised.

        However, in certain situations the keyword may raise certain 
        exceptions. For instance:

        ``FileNotFoundError``
        
        For instance if the passed ``xml_path`` is non-existing, points 
        to a non-xml file or points to an empty folder.
        
        ``IOError``
        
        If writing the CSV file fails due to filesystem restrictions.
