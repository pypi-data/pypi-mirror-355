"""
This module serves as the package entry point, by exposing the 
XmlValidator class directly at the package level.

It further provides versioning metadata for use in documentation and 
automation.

Features:

- Defines the public API (__all__, aliasing).
- Simplifies imports by exposing XmlValidator at the top level.
- Supports dynamic version retrieval/discovery from installed metadata.
- Maintains compatibility with Python < 3.8 via fallback imports.
"""


# pylint: disable=C0103:invalid-name    # On account of the class name, which is not snake-cased (required by RF).


# Import versioning utilities to fetch package metadata dynamically.
# - `version` retrieves the installed package version from metadata.
# - `PackageNotFoundError` handles cases where the package is not installed.
from importlib.metadata import version, PackageNotFoundError
# Expose XmlValidator directly for cleaner imports.
from .XmlValidator import XmlValidator


# Alias (i.e.: make available) XmlValidator at the package level for RF.
xmlvalidator = XmlValidator

# Define package metadata & control what is exposed when importing the package.
__all__ = ["XmlValidator"] # Controls what's exposed by: from package import *.
__author__ = "Michael Hallik"
# Expose the version (package version or fallback version).
try:
    # Fetches version when installed as package.
    __version__ = version("robotframework-xmlvalidator")

    # Fall back when package not installed (default version for development).

    warnings.warn("Package metadata not found, using fallback version.")
