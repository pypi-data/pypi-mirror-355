# This is the undertime sample configuration file
#
# This file tries to be exhaustive, but it's possible that an
# option was added to the command and was forgotten here. Any option
# available in the --help output can be used here. Furthermore, most
# entries are commented out to keep the displayed somewhat pretty and
# consistent.
#
# Changes made here need to be synced with the manual page
# (undertime.1), the shell completion (in extra/), and the argument
# parser (UndertimeArgumentParser in undertime.py).

# a few critical time zones from populous or interesting places on
# Earth
timezones:
  - America/Vancouver
  - America/New_York
  - UTC
  - Europe/Paris
  - Africa/Addis_Ababa
  - Asia/Hong_Kong
  - Pacific/Auckland

# Set the work day to be between 10:00 and 18:00 hours. Defaults to 9h
# and 17h.
# start: 10
# end: 18

# Disable colors
#colors: false

# Turn off the default of adding your own timezone to the table. I use
# this to control what zone will show up with the above list instead
# of letting the OS guess what zone i'm supposedly in right now.
#default_zone: false

# Deduplicate time zones to remove redundant offsets, defaults to true.
# unique: false

# Disable the overlap count column (labeled "n")
# overlap: false

# Restrict display to rows having only a certain overlap (defaults to
# no restriction, "0")
# overlap_min: 0

# Shorten column names to remove the Continent/Country prefix, useful
# if you end up with a very wide table. Defaults to false.
truncate: true

# Change table output format, see the `--help` output for valid
# options, or the `tabulate` Python package:
# https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/
format: fancy_grid_nogap

# Disable the table display altogether, which is useful once you have
# a good idea of good meeting times already and just want to check
# times for everyone just to make sure.
#
# The table can be re-enabled with --table, like many of the options
# below.
# table: false
