# Welcome to the {{project_name}} project.

## About this repository

Provide a general description of the repository.


## Installation

Provide detailed instructions to install the required dependencies. bw2scaffold prepares a `environment.yaml` if a conda environment is detected, or just a `requirements.txt` if not.

## Repository structure

This subsection should be used to present the repository structure.

> [!NOTE] The repository contains a predetermined structure.
>
> While these folders are mandatory, more children directories can be added if necessary.
> When running `bw2init packup`, the parser will only focus on this structure to building the report.
> In this sense, any non-children folder will be ignored.

## Computation graph

Here some diagrams and text explaining the followed computation is presented.
Leave the next part so `bw2init prepare` can automatically generate the graph.
