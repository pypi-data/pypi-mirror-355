<p align="center">    
    YWH Programs Selector is a CLI tool to filter bug bounty programs from platforms like YesWeHack.  
    It analyzes your YesWeHack private programs and reports, prioritizing them to identify optimal targets for your next hunt. It supports program comparison with other hunters and scope extraction for payload spraying.<br/><br/>

## Description

The scoring algorithm assigns points to programs based on strategic criteria:
* Recently updated programs receive higher scores than older ones
* Programs with fewer reports are prioritized over heavily reported ones
* Programs offering wildcard scopes rank higher than single-URL targets
* ... and more

All configuration values can be customized to align with your hunting preferences and strategy.

Additionally, the tool enables program comparison with other hunters, facilitating the identification of promising collaborations!

You can also extract all your program scopes in one place to spray payloads.

Authentication can be fully automated or provided manually by a bearer.


## Features
- [x] **Program Scoring**: Prioritizes programs based on updates, reports, and scope types.
- [x] **Collaboration**: Identifies common programs with other hunters.
- [x] **Scope Extraction**: Extracts program scopes for further analysis.
- [x] **Authentication**: Supports both automated and manual methods.
- [ ] **Scope finding**: Find a program from a specific scope url

## Installation
```bash
$> pip install ywh-program-selector
```

## Authentication  
If you want to fully automate the authentication part, you will be asked to provide your username/email, your password and your TOTP secret key.

All credential are stored locally in `$HOME/.config/ywh-program-selector/credentials`.

**How to obtain my TOTP secret key?**  
This data is only displayed once when you set up your OTP authentication from the YWH website.
If you have not noted it previously, you must deactivate and reactivate your MFA options.


## Usage

```bash
usage: ywh-program-selector [-h] [--silent] [--force-refresh] (--token TOKEN | --local-auth | --no-auth)
                            (--show | --collab-export-ids | --collaborations | --get-progs | --extract-scopes | --find-by-scope FIND_BY_SCOPE)
                            [--ids-files IDS_FILES] [--program PROGRAM] [-o OUTPUT] [-f {json,plain}]
