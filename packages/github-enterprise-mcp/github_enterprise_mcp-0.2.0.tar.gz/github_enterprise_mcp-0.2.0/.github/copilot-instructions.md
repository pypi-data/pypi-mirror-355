# GitHub Enterprise MCP Server Instructions

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server project for GitHub Enterprise Server integration. The server provides capabilities for repository access, branch creation, commits, and push operations.

You can find more info and examples at:

- https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server
- https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server

The project uses the `uv` package manager for Python. When working with this codebase, keep in mind that it's designed to serve as an MCP server for GitHub Enterprise Server, focusing specifically on repository management and Git operations.
