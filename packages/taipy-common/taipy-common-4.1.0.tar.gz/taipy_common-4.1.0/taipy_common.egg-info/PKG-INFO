## What is Taipy Config

Taipy is a Python library for creating Business Applications. More information on our
[website](https://www.taipy.io). Taipy is split into multiple packages including *taipy-common*
to let users install the minimum they need.

Taipy Config is a package designed to help users configure their Taipy application.

## Installation

The latest stable version of *taipy-common* is available through *pip*:
```bash
pip install taipy-common
```

You can install the development version of *taipy-common* with *pip* and *git* via the taipy repository:
```bash
pip install git+https://git@github.com/Avaiga/taipy
```

This command installs the development version of *taipy* package in the Python environment with all
its dependencies, including the *taipy-common* package.

If you need the source code for *taipy-common* on your system so you can see how things are done or
maybe participate in the improvement of the packages, you can clone the GitHub repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Avaiga/taipy.git
```

This creates the 'taipy' directory holding all the package's source code, and the 'taipy-common'
source code is in the 'taipy/common' directory.
