class BasePipelineStep(ABC, metaclass=abc.ABCMeta):
    """The base class for all pipeline steps.

    A pipeline step represents a single operation or task within a larger processing pipeline.
    Each step must implement:
    1. execute() - to perform the actual operation
    2. add_to_graph() - to integrate with the pipeline structure (optional, default implementation provided)

    The default implementation of add_to_graph is suitable for steps that:
    1. Have a single entry point
    2. Have a single exit point
    3. Connect to all previous endpoints

    For more complex graph structures (e.g., conditional branching), steps should override add_to_graph.

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for the pipeline step.

        This method is responsible for:

        2. Creating edges from previous endpoints to this step's entry points
        3. Returning this step's exit points (endpoints)

        This method provides a default implementation suitable for simple steps.
        Steps with more complex graph structures should override this method.
