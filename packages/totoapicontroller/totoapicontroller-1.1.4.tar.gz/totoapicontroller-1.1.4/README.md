# Toto API Controller for Python

This project aims at simplifying the creationg of python microservices using Flask, by creating some decorators to be added to routes (API endpoints) that take care of:
 - Basic validation of HTTP Headers
 - Authentication

This also provide simple logging utilities to uniform logs.

## Building and Deploying to Pypi
Make sure you have the file `setup.pyÂ´ and that the dependencies are setup. <br>
To **build** the package, run: 
```
python setup.py sdist
```

To **upload** the package to PyPi, run:
```
twine upload dist/* 
```

Note that to **publish** packages to PyPi, you need to authenticate via token. <br>
The token needs to be stored in `$HOME/.pypirc` in this format: 
```
[pypi]
  username = __token__
  password = pypi-AgEIcHlwaS5vcmcCJDMwZDZlMjYzLWExZWUtNGI0ZC......
```
Note that the "username" value is the string `__token__`. The actual token only goes in the password field.
