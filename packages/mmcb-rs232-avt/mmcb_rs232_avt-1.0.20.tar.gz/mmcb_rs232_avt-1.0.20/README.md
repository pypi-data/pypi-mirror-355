This repository provides command line tools to monitor and control equipment in the *ATLAS ITK pixels multi-module cycling box* test setup. It is used in the test setups for a number of other projects.

This repository mirrors a subset of files contained in the original [atlas-mmcb-avt](https://gitlab.ph.liv.ac.uk/avt/atlas-itk-pmmcb/) repository, the later remains the reference. This package contains only the RS232 laboratory control command line scripts, and excludes the Raspberry Pi specific I2C environmenal monitoring parts.
