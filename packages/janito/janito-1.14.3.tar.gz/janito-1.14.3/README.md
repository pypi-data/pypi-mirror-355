# 🚀 Janito: Language Model Thin Client

Janito is an AI-powered assistant for the command line and web that interprets natural language system_prompt_template to edit code, manage files, and analyze projects using patterns and tools designed by experienced software engineers. It prioritizes transparency, interactive clarification, and precise, reviewable changes.

## ⚡ Quick Start

## 🖥️ Supported Human Interfaces

Janito supports multiple ways for users to interact with the agent:

- **CLI (Command Line Interface):** Run single prompts or commands directly from your terminal (e.g., `janito "Refactor the data processing module"`).
- **CLI Chat Shell:** Start an interactive chat session in your terminal for conversational workflows (`janito`).
- **Web Interface:** Launch a browser-based UI for chat and project management (`janito --web`).

### 🛠️ Common CLI Modifiers

You can alter Janito's behavior in any interface using these flags:

- `--system` / `--system-file`: Override or customize the system prompt for the session.
- `--no-tools`: Disable all tool usage (Janito will only use the language model, no file/code/shell actions).
- `--trust-tools`/`-T`: Trusted tools mode (suppresses all tool output, only shows output file locations).
- `--vanilla`: Disables tools, system prompt, and temperature settings for a pure LLM chat experience.
- `--no-termweb`: Disables the termweb file viewer for terminal links.

These modifiers can be combined with any interface mode for tailored workflows.

## 📝 Full CLI Options Reference

The full list of CLI options has been moved to its own document for clarity. Please see [docs/CLI_OPTIONS.md](docs/CLI_OPTIONS.md) for a comprehensive, up-to-date reference of all supported command-line flags and their descriptions.

Run a one-off prompt:

```bash
janito "Refactor the data processing module to improve readability."
```

Or start the interactive chat shell:

```bash
janito
```

While in the chat shell, you can use special commands like `/reload` to reload the system prompt from a file without restarting your session. See the documentation for more shell commands.

Launch the web UI:

```bash
janito --web
```

## 🧑‍💻 System Prompt & Role

Janito operates using a system prompt template that defines its behavior, communication profile, and capabilities. By default, Janito assumes the role of a "software engineer"—this means its responses and actions are tailored to the expectations and best practices of professional software engineering.

- **Role:** You can customize the agent's role (e.g., "data scientist", "DevOps engineer") using the `--role` flag or config. The default is `software engineer`.
- **System Prompt Template:** The system prompt is rendered from a Jinja2 template (see `janito/agent/templates/profiles/system_prompt_template_base.txt.j2`). This template governs how the agent interprets system_prompt_template, interacts with files, and communicates with users.
- **Customization & Precedence:** Advanced users can override the system prompt with the `--system` flag (raw string), or point to a custom file using `--system-file`. The precedence is: `--system-file` > `--system`/config > default template.

The default template ensures the agent:

- Prioritizes safe, reviewable, and minimal changes
- Asks for clarification when system_prompt_template are ambiguous
- Provides concise plans before taking action
- Documents any changes made

For more details or to customize the prompt, see the template file at `janito/agent/templates/profiles/system_prompt_template_base.txt.j2` and the architecture overview in [docs/reference/architecture.md](docs/reference/architecture.md).

## 🥛 Vanilla Mode

Janito supports a "vanilla mode" for pure LLM interaction:

- No tools: Disables all tool use (no file operations, shell commands, etc.).
- No system prompt: The LLM receives only your input, with no system prompt or role injected.
- No temperature set: The temperature parameter is not set (unless you explicitly provide `-t`/`--temperature`).

Activate vanilla mode with the CLI flag:

```bash
python -m janito --vanilla "Your prompt here"
```

Or in chat shell mode:

```bash
python -m janito --vanilla
```

Vanilla mode is ideal for:

- Testing raw model behavior
- Comparing LLM output with and without agent guidance
- Ensuring no agent-side intervention or context is added

> Note: Vanilla mode is a runtime switch and does not change the Agent API or class signatures. It is controlled via CLI/config only.

## 👨‍💻 AgentProfileManager: Profile, Role, and Prompt Management

Janito now uses a dedicated `AgentProfileManager` class to manage user profiles, roles, interaction profiles, and system prompt selection. This manager:

- Stores the current role (e.g., "software engineer") and interaction profile (e.g., "default", "technical").
- Renders the system prompt from the appropriate template based on interaction profile.
- Instantiates and manages the low-level LLM Agent, passing the correct prompt.
- Provides methods to update the role, interaction profile, and refresh the prompt at runtime.

### Multiple System Prompt Templates

- The system prompt template is now selected based on the interaction profile (e.g., `default` or `technical`).
- Templates are located in `janito/agent/templates/` (see `system_prompt_template.j2` and `system_prompt_template_technical.j2`).
- You can switch interaction profiles at runtime using the profile manager, enabling different agent behaviors for different user needs.

This separation ensures that the LLM Agent remains focused on language model interaction and tool execution, while all profile, role, and prompt logic is managed at a higher level.

See `janito/agent/profile_manager.py` for implementation details.

### Agent Interaction Style

You can control the agent's behavior and prompt profile globally or per-project using the `profile` config key. See [Prompt Profiles Guide](docs/guides/prompt_profiles.md) for all available styles and combinations.

- `default`: Concise, general-purpose agent (default)
- `technical`: Strict, workflow-oriented for technical/developer use

Set globally:

```bash
janito --set-global-config profile=technical
```

Or per-project (in your project root):

```bash
janito --set-local-config profile=technical
```

You can also override for a session with the CLI flag:

```bash
janito --profile technical
```

See [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) for full details.

## 🧑‍💻 Combinatorial Style System

Janito now supports combinatorial profiles for system prompts, allowing you to combine a main profile (such as `default` or `technical`) with one or more feature extensions (such as `commit_all`).

- **Main profile:** The base agent behavior and workflow (e.g., `default`, `technical`).
- **Feature extensions:** Optional features that override or extend the main profile (e.g., `commit_all`).
- **Syntax:** Use a hyphen to combine, e.g., `technical-commit_all`.

**How it works:**

- The main profile template is loaded first.
- Each feature extension template is layered on top, overriding or extending specific blocks in the main template.
- Feature templates must use `{% extends parent_template %}` for dynamic inheritance.

**Example usage:**

```bash
janito --profile technical-commit_all
```

This will apply the `technical` profile with the `commit_all` feature enabled in the agent's system prompt.

See `janito/render_prompt.py` and `janito/agent/templates/` for implementation details and to create your own feature extensions.

## 📂 termweb File Viewer (Web File Preview)

Janito includes a lightweight web file viewer (termweb) that starts by default when you use the CLI chat shell. This feature allows you to click on file paths in the terminal (when using a Rich-compatible terminal) and instantly preview file contents in your browser—no full IDE required!

### How to Use

- Start the CLI chat shell normally:

  ```bash
  janito
  ```

- The termweb file viewer will start automatically by default.
- To disable the termweb file viewer, use the `--no-termweb` flag.
- By default, the viewer runs at http://localhost:8088 (or the next available port up to 8100).
- To specify a port, use `--termweb-port 8090`.
- File paths in CLI output become clickable links that open the file in your browser.

**Note:** The termweb file viewer is intended for quick file previews and review, not for editing or production use. Feedback is welcome!

### Why is this useful?

- Enables instant file previews from the CLI without a full IDE.
- Works with all Janito file tools and outputs that display file paths.
- Uses the Rich library’s link markup for clickable terminal links.
