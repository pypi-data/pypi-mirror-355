# quick-tts

Convert text to speech using OpenAI's Text-to-Speech API. A simple, effective Python package that works as both a library and command-line tool.

## Installation

```bash
pip install quick-tts
```

## Usage

### As a Library

```python
from quick_tts import text_to_speech

# Basic usage
text_to_speech("Hello, world!", "hello.mp3")

# With custom options
text_to_speech(
    text="Good morning!",
    output_file="morning.wav",
    model="tts-1-hd",
    voice="nova"
)
```

### As a Command-Line Tool

```bash
# Basic usage
quick-tts "Hello, world!" -o hello.mp3
